How to use JNSP
=====================

    command line:
    
    case 1:
	
	java -mx512MB -classpath <CLASSPATH> jnsp.Counter <OPTIONFILE>
	
    case 2:
    
	java -mx512MB -classpath <CLASSPATH> jnsp.Statistic <OPTIONFILE>
	<STATLIB> -window <WINDOW>
	
    where:
	
	-mx512MB: to extend heap memory for JVM
	
	<CLASSPATH> is the path to the "Counter.class" or "Statistic.class" file, and necessary lib for JNSP. 
	For instance, if we are currently at the home directory of JNSP, the <CLASSPATH> is "bin;lib\tokenfilter.jar"
