Ebdon polishes off hapless Gray

  Peter Ebdon secured his place in the quarter-finals with a session to spare after thrashing David Gray 13-2.  
 Ebdon, who led 6-2 overnight, did not lose a frame in the second session of a dour encounter. 
 The 2002 world champion will now face defending title-holder Shaun Murphy in the last eight at The Crucible. 
 Ebdon, who spurned a chance of a 147 break on Sunday, made just one half-century break in the session, racking up 53 points in frame 11.  
 The tables, which have been the subject of much criticism at this year's event, were re-covered on Sunday, and Ebdon felt the benefit. 
 "The table is beautiful now," said the 35-year-old, who is now based in Dubai. 
 "The new cloth is much more similar to the ones on which we prepare for the tournament and more conducive to producing quality snooker. 
 Gray, who beat Jimmy White in the opening round, could not explain his poor play. 
 "I just didn't play from start to finish," he said. 
 "Every time I got in the balls I seemed to get a 'kick' and it was just one of those nightmare games. I gave Peter so many chances. 
 "I felt all right after I had beaten Jimmy and it's a shame to finish the tournament on a bad note."
