Selby stuns Higgins at Sheffield

  Qualifier Mark Selby caused the first shock of the 2006 World Snooker Championship by beating 1998 winner John Higgins 10-4 on Sunday.  
 Selby, provisionally ranked 34, took a 6-3 lead into the final session, which was reduced to 6-4 after Higgins won the opening frame. 
 But the 22-year-old made a 123 and 58 break, before Higgins missed a yellow in the 13th to gift Selby the frame. 
 A 14th frame break of 110 ensured Selby of a famous victory.  
 The omens did not look good from the first frame for Higgins, who made a 54 break before Selby fought back to win 69-63. 
          I thought he was a player who wasn't going to do much      John Higgins        
 Selby won the next, before a nervy Higgins pulled one back in the fourth. 
 The Scot won two more frames, making a 119 break, but Selby made the most of his opponent's errors to take command. 
 Higgins was surprised at how well Selby played. 
 "I just couldn't get going," said the 1998 champion from Scotland. 
 "I thought he was a player who wasn't going to do much but he looks like one who could do very well now." 
 Selby added: "It's a dream come true. I was tense at the start of the match but I felt brilliant at the end. I believe I can go all the way now."
