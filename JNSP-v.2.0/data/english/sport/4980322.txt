Rusedski puts out seeded Robredo

  Greg Rusedski survived a tough test in the first round of the Rome Masters by beating Spanish clay-court expert and 12th seed Tommy Robredo 5-7 6-3 6-4.  
 The Briton saved set point at 5-3 down in the first set and then broke back to level at 5-5, but he immediately lost his serve and then the first set. 
 Rusedski raced through the second set to level the match and broke Robredo twice for a 4-1 lead in the decider. 
 Robredo got one break back but Rusedski held his nerve to seal the shock win.  
 Andy Murray and Tim Henman play their opening matches on Tuesday. 
 Rusedski, who will face Italian Stefano Galvani in the second round, will replace Murray as British number one if he out-performs the Scot in Rome this week.
