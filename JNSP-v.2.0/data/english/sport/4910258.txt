Profile: Mahela Jayawardene

        FACTFILE       Born:  27/5/77, Colombo    Right-hand batsman     Test debut:  v India,  Colombo 2/8/97    ODI debut:  v Zimbabwe, Colombo 24/1/98        
   A key batsman in Sri Lanka's middle order, Jayawardene is now adjusting to the added responsibility of captaincy.  
 He led the team to a 2-0 victory in Bangladesh after Marvan Atapattu pulled out of the tour but that was followed by a 1-0 home loss to Pakistan. 
 Atapattu's continuing back problems mean Jayawardene faces another tough assignment against England. 
 He accepts the team is in a rebuilding phase but a couple of centuries from him would help ease the pressure.
