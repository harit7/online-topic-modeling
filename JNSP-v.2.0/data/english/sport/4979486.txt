Van Pelt keeps lead in Charlotte

        R2 LEADERBOARD      -10  B Van Pelt (USA)   -7  J Furyk (USA)  -6  D Love III (USA)  -3  V Singh (Fij)  -5  S Appleby (Aus)   -4  T Immelman (RSA)       American Bo Van Pelt remained three strokes clear after the completion of the rain-interrupted second round in the Wachovia Championship in Charlotte.  
 Van Pelt carded a course-equalling eight-under 64 after a thunderstorm forced the players off on Friday. 
 After Saturday's resumption, Van Pelt was still clear of Jim Furyk (69), when the round was eventually concluded. 
 Davis Love was a shot back in third place with Vijay Singh tied for fourth with Australian Stuart Appleby on -5.   
 Play had been called off on Friday with 74 players still to complete their rounds. 
 Most interest on the resumption focused on whether Masters champion Phil Mickelson could close a seven-stroke deficit over the closing stretch at Quail Hollow. 
 But he bogeyed three of the last six holes - and by adding a 72 to his opening 71 was nine adrift of Van Pelt. 
 England's Justin Rose followed up his opening 70 with a disappointing 74 and at level par had dropped from eighth to 34th. 
 Countryman Greg Owen's closing bogey meant he missed the cut by one, joining Lee Westwood and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell. 
 English duo Luke Donald and Brian Davis had both pulled out of the tournament on Friday as the rains came. 
 Donald was right on the cut line at two-over but after a double-bogey six and three other bogeys he was clearly too frustrated to continue. 
 Davis, starting at the 10th, had fared even worse, completed nine holes to lay 10 over with no hope of making the cut. 
 The third round was being played later on Saturday.
