Myskina to miss Fed Cup campaign

  Russia's Anastasia Myskina is to miss her country's Fed Cup campaign.  
 The 24-year-old former world number two wants to focus on her individual career this season, having suffered a slump in the rankings last season. 
 Myskina helped Russia defend their Fed Cup title with a 3-2 victory over France in Paris last September. 
 But she said: "I'm expecting a very tough WTA season and I aim to concentrate more on my individual performances this year."  
 Myskina soared to being world number two in September 2004 following her victory in that season's French Open. 
 But she has since dropped to 12th after struggling for form last season. 
 Fellow Russian Maria Sharapova has also confirmed that will be unavailable for the Fed Cup campaign, which opens against Belgium in April.
