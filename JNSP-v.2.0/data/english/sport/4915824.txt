Classy Maguire beats dogged King

  Stephen Maguire showed some of the form that took him to the 2004 UK title with a 10-6 win over Mark King in a match that produced 11 half-century breaks.  
 The Scottish fourth seed took a 6-3 lead into the final session, but his advantage was reduced to two frames when King, 32, posted a break of 71. 
 Maguire hit back with a 78, before King replied with a 60. 
 The Scot won the next two, and after King fought back with a 54 in the 16th, he secured the win in the next frame.  
 Maguire said he was delighted to have reached the second round on his third attempt. 
 The 25-year-old Scot was beaten by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the opening round on his previous two visits to Sheffield. 
 "All I've been thinking about for weeks has been this match," he said. 
 "I am chuffed to bits because I love winning matches, whether it's the WorldSnooker Championship or just in the local club."
