Dott demands respect after upset

            My safety was better than his and when I got in I scored      Graeme Dott       Graeme Dott said he deserved more respect after reaching his second World Championship final.  
 Dott booked his place in the final with an emphatic 17-11 victory over world number one Ronnie O'Sullivan. 
 "It's impossible to fluke your way to the Crucible final - you have to play the best players in the world in a short space of time," said Dott. 
 "It annoys me I don't get the credit I deserve. It's just the way I play and they don't like it."   
 The 28-year-old took a 16-8 lead in his semi-final after making the most of O'Sullivan's lacklustre performance. 
 O'Sullivan won the first three frames of the final session, but Dott pulled on all his reserves to clinch the 28th frame and book a showdown against Peter Ebdon. 
               "I actually could believe how badly Ronnie performed, because he played like that in patches against Ryan Day and against Mark Williams in earlier rounds," said Dott. 
 "I put him under a lot of pressure. My safety was better than his and when I got in I scored. 
 "I beat Ronnie 5-0 in Malta and all I got was people saying that he gave up. Ronnie never got a shot in that match, but all the talk afterwards was about him giving up." 
 Dott, who was defeated by O'Sullivan in the Crucible final two years ago, said he was confident of beating Ebdon to claim his first ranking title. 
 "The experience I got from the 2004 final will help massively. I won't be overawed," he said. 
 "Peter won't give me an inch and I won't give him an inch. He'll be favourite because he's won tournaments, including the world title and I haven't won anything. But I like being the underdog."
