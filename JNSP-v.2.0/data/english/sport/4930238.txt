Weir clinches wheelchair marathon

  Britain's David Weir eased to victory in London Marathon wheelchair race and Italian Francesca Porcellato claimed her fourth straight women's title.  
 Weir, who also won in 2002, brushed aside pre-race favourite Saul Mendoza to claim his second London victory. 
 The Briton finished several minutes ahead of two-time winner Mendoza with a new course record of 1hr 29mins 48secs. 
 Meanwhile, Porcellato clocked 1:59:57 to win the women's race, ahead of British teenager Shelly Woods.  
 Rising wheelchair star Woods finished less than four minutes behind the Italian with a time of 2:04:37, while fellow Britons Deborah Brennan and 2000 winner Sarah Piercy were third and fourth respectively. 
          My target was to go under my personal best of 1:34, so I'm over the moon      David Weir        It was a repeat finish for 19-year-old Woods, who shot to fame last year when she finished just three seconds behind Porcellato on her marathon debut. 
 This year's race, organised by Disability Sport Events, saw a much wider gap between the two athletes as the Italian made her break midway through the event and never looked back. 
 Weir, better known for his sprint performances on the track, was also in blistering form in a contest marred by South African Ernst Van Dyk's crash early on. 
 Van Dyk, who became the first wheelchair athlete to break the one hour 20 minute-mark at the 2004 Boston Marathon, was one of the pre-race favourites but crashed out of contention after taking a turn too fast. 
               
 Meanwhile Mendoza, chasing his third straight London title, kept the same pace that won him last year's race but was no match for Weir, while Frenchman Alain Fuss came third. 
 "My target was to go under my personal best of 1:34," Weir said afterwards. "So I'm over the moon (with the course record)." 
 "I caught a cold on Saturday and I didn't have much sleep but I knew I could get through it with my training."
