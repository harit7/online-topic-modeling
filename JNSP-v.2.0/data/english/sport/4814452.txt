Miller misses out on Turin medal

  British skier Liz Miller finished 14th in the giant slalom event at the Winter Paralympics in Turin.  
 The 26-year-old from Hampshire, who is competing in her first Paralympics, clocked a time of two minutes 13.46 seconds over her two runs. 
 She finished 15 seconds behind the winner, Lauren Woolstencroft of Canada, but was pleased with her display. 
 "That performance was better than I expected and it sets me up for the slalom on Saturday," she said.  
 Sean Rose and Russell Docker will both compete in the men's seated giant slalom on Friday. 
 Also on Friday, the GB curlers face a semi-final showdown with Sweden as they chase a place in Saturday's final while the other semi-final sees Canada take on Norway. 
 The sledge hockey team will play hosts Italy in the 7th/8th play-off. The final will feature Norway against Canada.
