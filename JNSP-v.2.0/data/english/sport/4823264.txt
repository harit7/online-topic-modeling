Rose display is fitting farewell

   Tune in to BBC2's Sunday Grandstand on 26 March at 1400 BST to watch comprehensive highlights of the Winter Paralympics.  
   The last chance for Winter Paralympic medals was on the ski slopes on Sunday and Britain's Sean Rose finished in the top half of the Alpine slalom event.  
 Great Britain Paralympic team boss Phil Lane said: "Overall, there were creditable performances, especially from Sean Rose. 
 "Our target was to bring back a medal, and to win silver in the wheelchair curling was an excellent performance. 
 "The squad performed to expectations and have set standards for the future."  
 Lane added: "The sledge hockey team played valiantly in a difficult group, which included finalists Canada and Norway. 
 "And the team deserved their victories over Italy." 
 Canada went on to claim the gold by beating Norway 3-0 in the final, while Britain finished seventh overall. 
 Lane added: "We hope people watching will be inspired to take up Winter Paralympic sports. 
 Russia finished top of the medal table with 13 golds.
