Clinical Fu sweeps into quarters

  Marco Fu wasted no time in booking his place in the quarter-finals of the World Championship, sealing a 13-4 win over Stephen Maguire at The Crucible.  
 The 28-year-old Fu started Saturday's afternoon session with a commanding 12-4 lead, and knocked in a break of 101 to put Maguire out of his misery. 
 Fu won six of the eight frames of their second session, with Maguire struggling to keep the cue ball under control. 
 Maguire did make a break of 95 to win the 12th frame, but looked out of form.  
 The world number three said his disappointing season was a result of putting on too much weight. 
          I don't want to be a fat world champion!      Scotland's Stephen Maguire        
 "I'm just glad I didn't get beaten with a session to spare," said Maguire, who has struggled since winning the UK Championship in 2004. 
 "It's payback time for me. I put on weight last year and it's cost me the season. 
 "I'll have to get fitter to get back to where I was a couple of seasons ago. I don't want to be a fat world champion!" 
 Fu, meanwhile, insisted he had not been aware of a foul he committed during the final frame of the second session. 
 On a break of 22, Fu accidentally tapped the blue ball while stretching to pot a red with the rest, but did not call himself for the foul. 
 Referee Eirian Williams also missed the incident which allowed Fu to make a frame-winning 47 break. 
          It all seems to be working quite well      Marco Fu on working with new coach Terry Griffiths        
 "I honestly didn't know I had done it," said Fu, who will face Matthew Stevens or Ken Doherty in the last eight. 
 "I definitely would have owned up if I had realised. Snooker players are renowned for being sporting and we are very proud of that. 
 "I'll definitely keep up that tradition in future and admit any fouls right away. But this time I honestly wasn't sure which shot was being talked about." 
 Maguire said he believed Fu's explanation and admitted that it had made little difference to the outcome of the match. 
 Fu also credited coach Terry Griffiths - who won the World Championship back in 1979 - with his revival in form. 
 "He's been helping me with a few things: cue action, the way I grip the cue, the approach to the shot, angles - and it all seems to be working quite well."
