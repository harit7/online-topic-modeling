Coria fails on bad day for seeds

  Top seed Guillermo Coria was amongst a host of big names to crash out of the first round of the BMW Open in Munich.  
 The Argentine took the opening set from German Denis Gremelmayr but then crumbled to lose 3-6 6-2 6-3. 
 Another German Philipp Kohlschreiber upset second seed Mario Ancic of Croatia 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-5). 
 But it did not all go the home crowd's way as German favourite and fourth seed Tommy Haas then suffered a 6-3 7-6 (7-3) defeat to Croatia's Ivo Karlovic.  
 "It was very frustrating," said Haas, who saw Karlovic fire 22 aces. "He was very strong and if he keeps up like he did, all I can say is 'good luck'." 
 Kohlschreiber goes on to meet Czech Jan Hernych for a place in the last eight, while Karlovic takes on Bjorn Phau.
