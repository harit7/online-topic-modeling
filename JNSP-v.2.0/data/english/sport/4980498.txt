Championship wins Derby pointer

  Mick Channon's Championship Point won the Predominate Stakes at Goodwood, a trial for next month's Derby.  
 Championship Point completely outclassed the rest of the field, winning by seven lengths from Sienna Storm, with Senor Dali in third. 
 Rising Cross and Soft Centre dead-heated for first in the Lupe Stakes at Goodwood, a trial for next month's Oaks at Epsom. 
 The fancied Nyarhini, trained by Geoff Wragg, finished third.  
 Championship Point was ridden to victory by Ted Durcan, and the jockey said he would be suited by the Derby trip. 
 "A mile-and-a-half won't be an issue for him, he has a lovely action and stays well. At home he works with average horses, he wouldn't beat anything there but on the course, the sparks fly," said Durcan. 
 Channon added: "He won easily today and had a proper attitude and we'll go for the Derby now. The ground won't be a problem unless it's like a road, and it won't be. 
 "I've always looked at him as a Derby horse and Ted was actually convinced he'd get the St Leger trip."
