 The 28-year-old started the final round four shots off the lead, but five birdies helped her to 19 under par and she won by two shots. 
 Angela Stanford, the leader from round one, faded with a 73 to share second place with 2004 champion Lorena Ochoa. 
 England's Karen Stupples finished with a 68 and was tied for 20th on 10 under.   
 Kerr said: "This is proving to be a good time of year for me. Today I set out four behind but just went for everything and it paid off." 
 For Ochoa, who heads the money list, it was a fourth second place in a season in which she has also won the Takefuji Classic in Las Vegas. 
 Stupples finished birdie, eagle - and had three eagles over the tournament. 
 She said: "It was a good, solid week and I feel I'm ready for a good run. 
 "I was coming back from a week off through illness so to shoot four rounds under par was very pleasing." 
 Staffordshire's Sue Strudwick, who came out of retirement to play this week, followed her 67 on Saturday with a 72 for seven under and joint 28th, while Scot Mhairi McKay was a further shot back after a 70.
