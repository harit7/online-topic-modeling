GB curlers win Paralympic silver

  Great Britain's wheelchair curlers missed out on Winter Paralympic gold after losing 7-4 to Canada in a dramatic final in Turin.  
 In the last end, British skip Frank Duffy had one stone left to take out the Canadian stone and win the game. 
 But he missed, ensuring Canada were nearest to the house and that Britain would have to settle for silver. 
 Nevertheless, it equals the highest achievement by a British team or individual at the Paralympics.  
 "I've done that shot 100 times before but it just wasn't to be," said Duffy. "I had an accurate line and we were expecting a bit of curl, but didn't get it. 
 "It will haunt me for the rest of my life...no, I don't mean that. It's just a game of curling. We won a silver medal and I'm proud of that." 
 Team manager Ena Stevenson added: "At the moment we're disappointed that we didn't win but we will be really pleased with silver when everyone realises what they've achieved. 
 "The British team all played brilliantly and it's just a shame we didn't win." 
 Meanwhile in Alpine skiing, Liz Miller finished 19th in the women's slalom. 
 On Sunday, the last day of the Games, skiers Russell Docker, from Blandford, Dorset and Sean Rose, from Northampton, will be competing in the men¿s sitting slalom.
