Fasth snatches tense Spanish Open

        FINAL LEADERBOARD      GB & Ire unless stated    -18  J Bickerton, N Fasth (Swe)*   -17  P Archer, T Bjorn (Den), M Eliasson (Swe), JM Lara (Spa), G Orr, D Griffiths   -16  C Suneson   Selected others:    -9  C Montgomerie   * won at 4th play-off hole       Sweden's Niclas Fasth beat England's John Bickerton on the fourth play-off hole to win the Spanish Open title at San Roque on Sunday.  
 The 34-year-old Fasth hit an iron to within eight feet for a birdie to take his fourth European Tour victory. 
 Fasth said: "It was a bit more work than I was hoping for - I had it in my own hands but I nearly messed up." 
 Bickerton, eight back at the start of play, fired a course record-equalling 63 to set up the play-off.   
 Fasth, who celebrated his 34th birthday on Saturday, bogeyed the last two holes in regulation and looked to have given Bickerton the chance of an unlikely win. 
 But the 36-year-old Englishman's approach to the final play-off hole, the ninth, went into the hospitality area and he was forced to take a free drop. 
 He chipped to within six feet but Fasth, a Ryder Cup player in 2002, had an opening and this time he took it to seal his fourth European Tour title. 
 Thomas Bjorn was left kicking himself after missing from five feet on the 18th - a putt which would have put him in the play-off too. 
 The Dane had been three clear after grabbing birdies at five of his first six holes, but four-putted the eighth from 40 feet for a double bogey five. 
 Scotland's Colin Montgomerie carded a 71 to finish on nine under par in a tie for 28th.
