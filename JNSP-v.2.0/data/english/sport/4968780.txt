Venus returns with win in Poland

  Venus Williams claimed her first victory of 2006 with a straight-sets win over Poland's Urszula Radwanska at the J&S Cup in Warsaw on Wednesday.  
 The American had previously made just one appearance this year - losing in the first round of the Australian Open. 
 An elbow injury kept Williams away from tennis but, in only her second match since September, she beat 15-year old Radwanska 6-3 6-3. 
 Top seed Kim Clijsters later eased past Julia Vakulenko 6-3 6-2.  
 Third seed Elena Dementieva swept through her opening match 6-2 6-0 against Tatiana Perebiynis, and fifth seed Francesca Schiavone beat Elena Likhovtseva 6-4 6-1. 
           Good to see Venus back again, round 2 v Martina should be fascinating    From S       
 Williams said she had been "really eager" to get back into competition and was happy with her performance against Radwanska. 
 "I think I'll just improve on that, and each match at this point is important for me to get a rhythm and start dominating," said Williams. 
 "I did rehab and tried to get better the best that I could. I wasn't playing at 100% - preparation or health - and I didn't want to come back until I knew I could do that." 
 Williams will now face the rejuvenated Martina Hingis in round two. 
 "I definitely look forward to that," said Williams. "She's had a great year so far just living her dreams. 
 "I think everyone's happy for her, and I'm happy for her. It should be a very good match tomorrow."
