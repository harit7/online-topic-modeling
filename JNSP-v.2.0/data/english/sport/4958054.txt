 Griffiths is 17 under par, two ahead of Swedish duo Niclas Fasth (66) and Robert Karlsson (68) and three shots clear of Denmark's Thomas Bjorn (68). 
 Overnight leader Graeme Storm carded a 70 to finish three shots off the lead. 
 Scotland's Colin Montgomerie carded a level-par 72 and is nine off the pace while England's Barry Lane had an ugly 77 to finish on three under.   
 Montgomerie said: "Nothing happened at all. I'm focused enough, but Ididn't really play very well. Never mind - a 60 tomorrow and you never know." 
 Griffiths said: "It's a brand new experience for me. I've never led beforeand it will be interesting whatever happens. 
 "I'm just going to try to keep doing what I'm doing. I felt really good todayand I really pleased. I think I can win." 
 Griffiths finished third in the European tour qualifying school in San Roque last November. 
 The 25-year-old from Watford had the first top 10 finish of his tourcareer in Madeira a month ago.
