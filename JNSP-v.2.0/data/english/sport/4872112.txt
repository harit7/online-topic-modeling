Cooke upbeat on World Cup hopes

  Nicole Cooke feels she can still win this year's World Cup after finishing sixth in the Tour of Flanders.  
 In her first event since taking bronze in the Commonwealth Games road race, the Univega Raleigh Lifeforce star won a four-woman sprint for the sixth spot. 
 That was five places ahead of Ina Teutenberg, who tops the World Cup standings on 120 points to Cooke's 42. 
 "It's all pretty close in the overall standings, there's still a long way to go with nine rounds left," said Cooke.  
 "It was great to be racing back in Europe, although the weather was pretty grim." 
 The prestigious Flanders race was won by Dutch Buitenpoort-Flexpoint rider Mirjam Melchers. 
 Cooke's Austrian team-mate Christiane Soeder was a close second.
