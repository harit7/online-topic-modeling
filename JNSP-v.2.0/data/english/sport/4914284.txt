Doherty defeats debutant Hawkins

  Ireland's Ken Doherty moved swiftly into the second round at The Crucible after a commanding 10-1 victory over qualifier Barry Hawkins.  
 The 1997 world champion held an 8-1 lead at the close of play on Easter Sunday before wrapping up the last two frames 52-33, 62-17. 
 After taking the first frame of the match, Hawkins' nerves got the better of him on his championship debut. 
 Doherty will face either Matthew Stevens or Joe Swail next.  
 Despite rattling off 10 successive frames, Doherty did not have to produce any spectacular shots to get past Hawkins. 
 Nonetheless he was satisfied with the manner of his victory against Hawkins, who will enter the ranks of the world top 10 next season. 
          Ken had nobody to beat and I'm gutted after such a good season to have played like that.      Barry Hawkins        
 "It was a workmanlike performance but I'm very pleased," said Doherty, seeded 12th. 
 "It doesn't matter who you are, on your Crucible debut it takes you a while to settle down, and I put the pressure on Barry and compounded it frame after frame." 
 But Hawkins was disappointed with his display saying: "I just couldn't perform and I can't explain why. 
 "Ken had nobody to beat and I'm gutted after such a good season to have played like that. 
 "I squandered the chances I had and it's a bad place to be when you start missing."
