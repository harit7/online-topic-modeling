Guineas blow for injured Nakheel

  Leading fancy Nakheel has been ruled out of the Stan James 2,000 Guineas after being found to have suffered a stress fracture of his pelvis.  
 Trainer Mark Johnston reported Nakheel to be "stiff and sore" last week and scrapped plans for a racecourse gallop at Newmarket's Craven meeting. 
 A bone scan on the three-year-old colt subsequently revealed the fracture. 
 Johnston said: "The Guineas is out and it's probably going to be the second half of the season before he is back."  
 Nakheel won both of his starts last term and had been as short as 10-1 with Totesport for the Newmarket Classic on 6 May.
