Ide future at Aguri under threat

  New team Super Aguri are considering dropping their rookie Japanese driver Yuji Ide after another poor race.  
 Team manager Daniele Audetto said he would decide whether to retain Ide after the European Grand Prix on 7 May. 
 Audetto said: "The second driver has to perform. We should give him a little bit more time, not too much but certainly a little bit more." 
 "We should see how he races at the Nurburgring, which is not a difficult circuit, and then we will decide."  
 Audetto hinted that any replacement would also be Japanese, although he added that it would be hard to find a better qualified driver than Ide. 
 Hiroki Yoshimoto finished third in the junior GP2 series race on Sunday and Audetto revealed he had met him the day before. 
 Audetto said he would like to offer Yoshimoto a test drive but added that Super Aguri's lack of resources would make that difficult. 
 Meanwhile, Super Aguri are hoping to introduce their new car at the French Grand Prix on 16 July. 
 The car they have used so far this season is based on a four-year-old desig by the now-defunct Arrows team.
