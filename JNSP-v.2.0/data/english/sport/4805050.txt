MotoGP coverage on the BBC

  BBC Sport is bringing you coverage of every MotoGP race in 2006.  
 It looks set to be a thrilling season, with five-time champion Valentino Rossi set to be challenged by a host of exciting and talented riders. 
 The TV team continues as last year - Suzi Perry will be presenting the action, while Steve Parrish and Charlie Cox will be in the commentary box. 
 But there is a new member of the team in Matt Roberts, who will be the BBC's pit lane reporter.  
               
 A selection of Saturday's qualifying sessions will be viewable on BBC Interactive (via your red button) and after certain races MotoGP Extra will show interviews and highlights.
