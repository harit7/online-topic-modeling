Woods says 'thank you' to DeLisle

  Clinton Woods says he owes his world title to Jason DeLisle, who he meets in a rematch in Sheffield on 13 May.  
 The IBF light heavyweight champion was floored by DeLisle in their non-title fight in 2004 before hitting back to stop the Australian in the final round. 
 "If I hadn't been tested, maybe I'd not have been as confident going into the Rico Hoye fight," said Woods, who won his world title from Hoye in 2005. 
 "So, in a funny way, DeLisle is getting a reward for knocking me down."  
 When Woods fought DeLisle he was coming off a loss to Glen Johnson in a world title fight and admits his career flashed before his eyes when he was knocked down. 
          I knew not only was I going to win the fight, but that I'd go on and win the world title as well      Clinton Woods        
 "The thought crossed my mind when DeLisle put me down, 'Am I shot?'," said Woods, who has defended his world title once. 
 "I had boxed awfully in the rematch with Glen Johnson and now I'd been put down for only the second time in my career. 
 "I got to my feet and I knew not only was I going to go on and win the fight but that I'd go on and win the world title as well." 
 Woods stopped undefeated American Hoye in five one-sided rounds in his next fight, finally winning a world title at the fourth attempt. 
 Woods has a mandatory defence with Jamaican Johnson, who gave up the IBF belt after defending it once against Roy Jones Jr, on the horizon.
