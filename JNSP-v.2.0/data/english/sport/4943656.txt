Ruthless Ebdon dethrones Murphy

  Peter Ebdon snuffed out the revival of defending champion Shaun Murphy to book a place in the last four of the World Championship with a 13-7 win.  
 Murphy started the morning session 7-1 behind but runs of 77, 83 (twice) and 113 to brought it back to 10-6. 
 Ebdon almost made a 147 for the second time in two days when the match resumed, but missed the last red. 
 Murphy dug deep to make it 12-7, but Ebdon nicked a scrappy final frame to wrap up the match.  
 Murphy's defeat ensures no first-time world champion has ever successfully defended his crown. 
          It was really nice to be cheered out. It's been quite an emotional day, but not all in a bad way      Shaun Murphy        
 Ebdon, who will now play Hong Kong qualifier Marco Fu, applauded Murphy out of the arena despite blowing the chance of winning £157,000 for a maximum clearance and highest break. 
 "I did that because I really appreciate everything Shaun has done for snooker as world champion over the last 12 months," said the 2002 champion, who now lives in Dubai. 
 "He has put himself out for the game and done an outstanding job, and I wanted to say thank you for that." 
 As for the 147 attempt, he added: "What a nightmare! I put a touch of left-hand side on the shot and just caught it too thick." 
 Murphy said: "It was really nice to be cheered out. It's been quite an emotional day but not all in a bad way. 
 "The first session will haunt me for a few weeks and I've no idea why I played so badly in it. But Peter is on top of his game and is my tip to win the title now."
