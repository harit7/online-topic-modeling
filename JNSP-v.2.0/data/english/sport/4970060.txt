Soviet heads Lockinge contenders

  Soviet Song heads 15 horses left in Newbury's Group One Juddmonte Lockinge Stakes at the latest forfeit stage.  
 She is set to make her seasonal bow in the 20 May race after injury sidelined her towards the end of last season. 
 The six-year-old mare was last seen when beaten by Proclamation in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood and is set to clash with that rival again at Newbury. 
 Proclamation, now trained by Godolphin after leaving Jeremy Noseda, could be joined by stablemate Valixir.  
 Aidan O'Brien has left in Ace and Ad Valorem while Sir Michael Stoute has recent Sandown winner Rob Roy along with Peeress. 
 Majors Cast, New Seeker, Common World, Court Masterpiece, Kandidate, Mac Love, Rocamadour and Tarfah complete the confirmations.
