Tokyo joins race for 2016 Games

  Tokyo has joined Fukuoka in competing for the right to be Japan's official bid city for the 2016 Olympics.  
 The city last hosted the summer Games in 1964 and its new bid was welcomed by the Japanese Olympic Committee (JOC). 
 "We would like Tokyo to do their best to produce a wonderful plan," said JOC chairman Tsunekazu Takeda. 
 "The aim is not only to win domestically, but also to beat the candidates from overseas. We look forward to seeing a high-level bid."  
 Tokyo entered the race after two other cities, Sapporo and Nagoya, ruled themselves out. 
 Sapporo, which hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, said it would be unable to raise the estimated $2.1bn needed to cover its share of the $15.2bn total cost of the Games. 
 But Tokyo had no such worries and its metropolitan assembly voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution to enter the race for 2016. 
 "For Tokyo to host the Olympics again after half a century would be an opportunity to demonstrate our strong desire for world peace and it would also be a chance to create a mature, safe and environmentally friendly city," the resolution said on the assembly's website. 
 The JOC will select the country's official bid city in August. 
 The International Olympic Committee will decide who stages the 2016 Games in 2009.
