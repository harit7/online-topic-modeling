 War of Attrition, who had not run since the festival success in March, always seemed to have plenty in reserve. 
 Michael Hourigan's two runners, Beef or Salmon and Hi Cloy, ran well to finish second and third. 
 "He would not have enjoyed going out in front but he was absolutely super," said jockey Conor O'Dwyer.   
 War Of Attrition set a moderate early pace before beginning to wind up thetempo approaching the 11th fence. 
 Forget The Past soon felt the change in pace as he clattered the 12th fenceand Barry Geraghty was lucky to stay aboard. 
 However, War Of Attrition made no such mistake and O'Dwyer had time to lookover his shoulder coming to the second-last and the seven-year-old only had to bekept up to his work thereafter. 
 Runner-up Beef Or Salmon turned in a much-improved performance afterdisappointing at Aintree and Cheltenham to finish a length and a half in frontof his stablemate.
