India to take game to the masses

  India's cricket chiefs say they will attempt to raise extra revenue by staging "home" matches against other countries at venues across the globe.  
 The Board of Control for Cricket in India is inviting bids for global media rights for any matches India will play on neutral grounds for five years. 
 "The main objective is to take the game to expats who only get to watch matches on TV," said the BCCI's Lalit Modi. 
 India will aim to play in venues like the USA, Canada and Malaysia.  
 It has also identified the Middle East, Hong Kong and Singapore as "key markets" where it wants India's already weary travelling cricketers to play. 
 Reuters news agency believes the BCCI can raise an extra £115 million through this initiative. 
 Modi said: "We have played in neutral venues before. Those days, we gave away the TV rights. Now we are selling them ourselves." 
 However, the International Cricket Council has already expressed fears the plans could be in conflict with its future tours programme of Tests and one-day internationals. 
 A spokesman told BBC Sport: "They need to be mindful of the volume of cricket already played and they will need to have the support of their player group. 
 "The recommendation from players and their representatives is that they should not be looking to play more than 15 Test matches and 30 one-day internationals in a year."
