Athletics footwear: throwing shoes

  
  This shoe is made specifically for those throwing with spinning styles.  
 A hooked strap over the toes help to stop your feet moving sideways during the build up to the throw. 
 No spikes this time, but a hard sole lengthens the life of the shoe. 
 And the circular grooving on the balls of the feet helps with the spinning motion of the athlete.
