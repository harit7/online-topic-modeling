Dott holds off O'Sullivan revival

  Graeme Dott moved into his second World Championship final after clinching the one frame he needed to seal a 17-11 win over Ronnie O'Sullivan at The Crucible.  
 Dott won all eight frames of an amazing morning session to take an almost unassailable 16-8 lead, but he had to bide his time before securing the win. 
 O'Sullivan found form to take the first three frames and raise his fans' hopes. 
 He got in among the balls again in a desperately tense final frame but Dott finally won it on the black.  
               Dott had his nerves tested in the final session as O'Sullivan started to eat into his commanding lead, but the two-time champion had left himself too much to do after a terrible display in the previous session. 
 O'Sullivan, who will lose his world number one status after the tournament, must take credit for not giving up in the last session, and a break of 60 in the first frame cut Dott's lead. 
   
 Another 60 in the next frame continued O'Sullivan's revival, and he looked to be building up a real momentum when he took the snatched a third frame. 
 With the nerves starting to jangle, Dott wasted several opportunities, but the problem was contagious as O'Sullivan also started to fluff the chances. 
 And Dott was finally able to win the match when O'Sullivan left the black near the pocket for the relieved Scot to pot. 
 In a remarkable morning session which had resumed at 8-8, Dott left O'Sullivan trailing. 
 He took the first of the session with a 92, emerged victorious from a tactical battle in the next, and runs of 86 and 49 put him 12-8 ahead at the interval. 
 The Scot showed no mercy on the players' return, making a 47 to go five frames ahead and followed it up by winning the next after another O'Sullivan mistake. 
 O'Sullivan conceded the next frame with one snooker required, and Dott made a 53 in the final frame to cap a superb session. 
 Beset by cue-tip problems throughout the tournament, O'Sullivan appeared to lose concentration with as a series of elementary errors. 
 It was the third time O'Sullivan has been whitewashed in a session at The Crucible, suffering the same fate against John Parrott in 1994 and John Higgins in 1998. 
               
 The match was also punctuated by a controversial incident with O'Sullivan's cue-tip in the second session. 
 With the scoreline at 7-7, O'Sullivan appeared to take the tip off himself, forcing a 15-minute break, but he escaped any punishment. 
 The first session had ended 5-3, after Dott dug deep to win a crucial last frame of the session to avoid a four-frame deficit.
