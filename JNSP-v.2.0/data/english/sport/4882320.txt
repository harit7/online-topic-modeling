Injured Shirley to miss World Cup

  American amputee sprinter Marlon Shirley has been forced to pull out of next month's Visa Paralympic World Cup through injury.  
 The Athens Paralympics 100m gold medallist was due to face South African rival Oscar Pistorius over the same distance in Manchester. 
 He was also scheduled to compete in the long jump. 
 But the 28-year-old has suffered a torn cruciate ligament which has ruled him out of the event.  
 The American sustained the injury during a training session at the IPC World Indoor Championships in Sweden last month and will undergo surgery next week. 
 Shirley also missed last year's Paralympic World Cup with an injury. 
   There will be live TV coverage on BBC2's Sunday Grandstand at 1330-1730 BST on 7 May
