McCain forced to delay retirement

  Trainer Ginger McCain, who was expected to retire after saddling Inca Trail in Saturday's Betfred Gold Cup, has been forced to carry on for a short period.  
 McCain, winner of four Grand Nationals including three with Red Rum, is due to hand over to his son Donald. 
 But Donald told BBC Ceefax: "The Jockey Club haven't allowed me to take over, so he is having to go on for a little bit longer I think. 
 "He's carrying on until I have done the required courses at Newmarket."  
 He added: "To be honest, I don't know how long it will be. We're in the process of sorting things out." 
 McCain won the National at Aintree with Red Rum in 1973, 1974 and 1977, and was successful again when Amberleigh House triumphed in 2004. 
 The Cheshire-based trainer had three runners in his last National at Aintree earlier in the month, with Inca Trail performing best in eighth. 
 McCain bought the horse, who runs at Sandown on Saturday, for more than £100,000 just weeks before on behalf of owner John Halewood.
