 Such is the unpredictability of their batting line-up, however, it would not be a major surprise to see him figure in the Test side at some stage. 
 Was given a one-day baptism of fire against Australia in Perth, reputedly the fastest pitch in the world. 
 He responded with a useful 22 off 25 balls and made his maiden fifty for Sri Lanka against Pakistan in March.
