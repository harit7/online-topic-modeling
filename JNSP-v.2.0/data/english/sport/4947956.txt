Packers legend Favre to play on

  NFL great Brett Favre has told the Green Bay Packers that he will return to play another season with them.  
 The 36-year-old Favre had previously refused to commit himself after the Packers endured their first losing season with him in 2005. 
 Packers general manager Ted Thompson said: "We are very pleased that Brett has come to this decision." 
 Reports say that Favre informed Thompson and coach Mike McCarthy of his decision by phone on Tuesday morning.  
 The quarterback has contemplated retirement during the past several off-seasons - only to return each time. 
 A fortnight ago, Favre said he wondered whether the team had improved enough in the off-season to justify him coming back. 
 He said that the team needed to make a "statement" similar to the signing of Reggie White - a star defensive lineman - in 1993. 
 Favre ranks second behind Dan Marino on the NFL's career list in touchdown passes (396), yards passing (53,615) and completions (4,678), and hold the records for most consecutive starts by a quarterback with 221 (241 including the play-offs). 
 He has led the Packers to six divisional crowns and a Super Bowl title, in the process restoring pride to one of the NFL's most famous names.
