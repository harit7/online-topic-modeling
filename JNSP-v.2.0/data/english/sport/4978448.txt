Kuznetsova puts out sloppy Venus

  Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated Venus Williams 6-4 6-2 to reach the semi-finals of the J&S Cup in Warsaw.  
 Serving at 5-4, the American wasted five game points before two further mistakes gave Kuznetsova the set. 
 Williams' game fell apart in the second set as Kuznetsova triumphed to set up a clash with compatriot Anna Chakvetadze. 
 Top seed Kim Clijsters of Belgium beat Italy's Francesca Schiavone 6-4 6-4 and will face Russian Elena Dementieva in the last four of the clay event.  
 Third seed Dementieva secured her safe passage with a 5-7 6-3 6-1 win over Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska while unseeded Chakvetadze had an impressive 4-6 6-2 6-4 win over Serbian Ana Ivanovic. 
 Kuznetsova said the key to her victory over seventh seed Williams was her greater consistency. 
 "I was focusing to put as many balls back as I could, and sometimes she made easy mistakes," said the fourth seed. 
 Williams said the leg cramps she felt during Thursday's three-set match with Martina Hingis didn't hamper her, but revealed she was pleased to have come through her first tournament since January. 
 "She definitely played consistently, but I feel there were too many errors," said Williams. 
 "I had a good week and had three matches. I felt fine and felt I could get to the ball. I'm very happy to be back and feel definitely I can handle anything that comes my way."
