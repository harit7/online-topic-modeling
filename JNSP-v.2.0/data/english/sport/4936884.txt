Neal seals Mondello Park double

  Matt Neal overcame a poor start to his British Touring Car Championship defence with a double race win at Ireland's Mondello Park on Sunday.  
 The Evesham-based driver had crashed out in Brands Hatch two weeks ago but clinched two wins and a third place on Sunday in his Honda. 
 In race one, he held off Seat's Jason Plato from pole and then doubled up in the second, with Plato second again. 
 Neal failed to win again in race three, which Mike Jordan won in a Honda.
