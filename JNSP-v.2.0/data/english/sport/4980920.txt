Savoldelli opens Giro defence

  Paolo Savoldelli got the defence of his Giro d'Italia title off to the perfect start, winning Saturday's first stage.  
 The Italian captain of the Discovery Channel team claimed the 6.2km time trial around the Belgium city of Seraing in seven minutes 50 seconds. 
 Australian Bradley McGee finished 11 seconds adrift, with Spain's Jose Enrique Gutierrez and German Stefan Schumacher sharing third. 
 The three-week race moves to Italy on Wednesday after the first four stages.  
 Italian title favourite Ivan Basso finished 23 seconds off Savoldelli's pace with Jan Ullrich, who is recovering from a knee injury, 49 seconds behind. 
 Savoldelli will wear the leader's pink jersey for Sunday's 197km second stage from Mons to Charleroi.
