Hantuchova parts with coach again

  World number 16 Daniela Hantuchova has parted company with British coach Nigel Sears for the second time.  
 The Slovak said she would explain the reasons behind the split at next week's J&S Cup in Poland. 
 The 23-year-old worked with Sears from 2001 until 2003 before teaming up with him again the following year. 
 Hantuchova reached a career-high of five in January, 2003, while working with Sears, whose daughter Kim has been romantically linked with Andy Murray.
