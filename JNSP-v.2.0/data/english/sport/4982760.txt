Nalbandian secures Estoril crown

  Top seed David Nalbandian beat Nikolay Davydenko 6-3 6-4 to take the men's title at the Estoril Open.  
 The Argentine world number four was rarely troubled by his second-seeded but out-of-sorts Russian opponent at a windy National Stadium in Portugal. 
 Nalbandian's victory gave him a second Estoril crown to add to his 2002 title. 
 "To return four years after the first triumph and win again is very positive," said Nalbandian. "This has been a very good week for me."  
 Davydenko, the 2003 winner, who earlier struggled with back pains, admitted he was not in the best of shape. 
 "I didn't feel any pain but I was not in shape, maybe due to tiredness," he said. 
 "Today, Nalbandian was unarguably better. I couldn't focus like I should have and there was little I could do in this final."
