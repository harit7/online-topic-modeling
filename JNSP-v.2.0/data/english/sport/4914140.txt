World silver for veteran MacLean

  Craig MacLean picked up his second silver of the World Track Championships on the final day of competition in the men's sprint in Bordeaux.  
 The Scottish cyclist, who had finished behind France in the team event, was no match for Theo Bos, of the Netherlands, in the individual final. 
 The 34-year-old misjudged his ride in the first of three legs to be left trailing in his rival's wake. 
 And he was again second best in the second leg to end his hopes of gold.  
 MacLean had shown great tactical nous in his semi-final against Mickael Bourgain to come from a ride down to beat the Frenchman and book his showdown with Bos. 
 After his silver medal the Scot told BBC Sport: "The semi-final had taken a lot out of my legs and it was always going to be a big ask to beat Theo even without that. 
          It couldn't happen to a nicer guy      British cycling boss Dave Brailsford on Craig MacLean        "He made me look silly in the first race but I gave him a better ride on the second leg. 
 "But to pick up two world championship silver medals and a gold at the Commonwealth Games [for Scotland in the team sprint] makes for a much better summer." 
 Afterwards British cycling perfromance director Dave Brailsford said he was "ecstatic" after MacLean's double silver. 
 "He's had a difficult two years since the Olympics," said Brailsford. "He now has two silver medals and he's really deserved it. It couldn't happen to a nicer guy." 
 His second silver meant the British team left Bordeaux with one gold, courtesy of Chris Hoy in the men's kilometre time trial, four silvers and a bronze. 
 Earlier, Britian's Victoria Pendleton failed to qualify for the final stages of the women's keirin. 
 The British pairing of Rob Hayles and Mark Cavendish also missed out on a medal in the men's madison on Sunday, ending the event in fourth place. 
 The gold won by Spain ahead of the Ukraine and bronze-medal winners Argentina.
