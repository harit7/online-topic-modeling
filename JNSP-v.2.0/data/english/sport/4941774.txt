Injury changes Sotherton's plans

  Commonwealth Games champion Kelly Sotherton will not do another full heptathlon until August's European Championships because of injury.  
 The 29-year-old has revealed that she won the title in Melbourne last month with a broken bone in her back. 
 "I've had intensive treatment and now I'm keeping up my fitness levels although I'm not training," she told the Daily Telegraph. 
 "I'm hoping I'll come back for a shorter season, refreshed and hungry."  
 Sotherton added that she was aiming to take part in a couple of events at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Gateshead on 11 June.
