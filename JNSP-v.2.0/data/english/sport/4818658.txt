Nicholls handed Cheltenham title

  Paul Nicholls has belatedly been awarded the title of top trainer at the Cheltenham Festival.  
 Nicky Henderson was initially handed the honour, but the rules had been misinterpreted by officials. 
 Both men had three winners but the award should have gone to the trainer with the most prize money, not the trainer with most seconds and thirds. 
 "It was a great week and that's the icing on the cake," said Nicholls, who also leads the trainers' championship.  
 Ruby Walsh, stable jockey to Nicholls, just edged out Tony McCoy for the Racing Post Festival Jockeys' Championship. 
 He clinched the win with victory in the final race of the meeting, the County Hurdle, on 4-1 joint-favourite Desert Quest. 
 That gave Walsh three wins and three second places at the Festival, with McCoy earning three firsts, two second and four third places. 
  Ireland recorded a record total of 10 victories at the Festival, with Britain gaining 14 wins.
