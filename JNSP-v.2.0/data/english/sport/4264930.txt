Athletics footwear: jumps and pole vault

  
  This shoe is designed to help your speed on the ground and movement through the air.  
 Laces are often replaced by strapping. 
 The shoe is more streamlined but the support keeps your foot still while you are jumping. 
 The sole will tend to be firm yet flexible for extra bounce in the jump. 
 And again, the spikes have their part to play. 
 The grip is crucial in helping to propel you either over the bar or across the sand.
