Harrison switches to new trainer

  Audley Harrison has teamed up with trainer Buddy McGirt to revitalise his ailing career - and he expects to fight again before the end of the month.  
 The 34-year-old has split with trainer Thell Torrance following a second consecutive defeat against Dominick Guinn in California last month. 
 That followed a shocking performance in his points loss to fellow Briton Danny Williams in London last December. 
 "Buddy has what it takes to improve my performances", Harrison said.  
 The 2000 Olympic super-heavyweight champion again rubbished claims that he considered quitting the ring following those back-to-back defeats. 
          I am going to train harder, listen more, believe more, focus more and do whatever is necessary to get back on track.      Audley Harrison        
 "Retirement will be an option if an opponent takes me out or I no longer find the motivation to train," he told his official website. 
 "The answer lies within me, and it has taken two unnecessary losses for me to realise how close I have come to throwing so much away. 
 "Upon hours of reflection I have realised I have turned up to fight without being 100% prepared for victory. 
 "This is the biggest challenge of my life so far and I refuse to end my career like this. 
 "I refuse to walk away. I am going to train harder, listen more, believe more, focus more and do whatever is necessary to get back on track." 
 New York-based McGirt, the former two-time world welterweight champion, is one of boxing's most respected trainers. 
 He has recently been involved with the likes of light-welterweight warrior Arturo Gatti and former WBO heavyweight champion Lamon Brewster.
