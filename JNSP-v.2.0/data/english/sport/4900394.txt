Neal not happy after crashing out

  Reigning British Touring Car Champion Matt Neal aired his frustration after crashing out of Sunday's third round race at Brands Hatch.  
 The Evesham-based driver was in second place before a crash forced him into retirement, his first in 33 BTCC races. 
 "We could have had a mega points score this weekend with two thirds and a second," he said. 
 "To walk away with not only a non-finish from the third race but also a wrecked car makes me very angry."
