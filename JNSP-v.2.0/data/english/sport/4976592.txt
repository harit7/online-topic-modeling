Eastbourne to host Davis Cup tie

  Great Britain's next Davis Cup tie against Israel on 21-23 July will take place on the grass courts of Eastbourne's Devonshire Park.  
 Britain must win the Europe/Africa Zone tie to avoid a relegation play-off. 
 GB captain Jeremy Bates said: "We are very excited about heading back to the grass in Eastbourne. 
 "The conditions are always perfect there and I'm sure the home crowd will provide us with fantastic support for this important tie."  
 Devonshire Park last hosted a Davis Cup event in 1995, when Great Britain defeated Monaco.
