Cooke dominates Magali Pache TT

  Wales' Nicole Cooke won the biggest time trial of her career in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sunday.  
 The 23-year-old was fastest over a tough 20km course to take the prestigious Magali Pache TT, beating a high quality field of riders. 
 It was Cooke's first time trial success since becoming Junior World Time Trial Champion in 2001. 
 Univega Raleigh Lifeforce team-mate Priska Doppmann finished second, with Bigla rider Zoulfia Zabirova third.  
 "I am so excited with this result. For the last few years it has been a roller-coaster ride with injuries, crashes and problems with teams failing to pay wages," Cooke told her official website. 
 "At long last things seem to be settling out. I am with a superbly organised team, I am able to train properly and things are starting to go right."
