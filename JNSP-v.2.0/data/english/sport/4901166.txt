BPA happy with funding increase

  The British Paralympic Association (BPA) has welcomed the increase in UK Sport funding ahead of the 2012 Games.  
 Summer Paralympic sport will benefit by £6.5m over the next three years. 
 Discussions will take place with UK Sport to decide the sport-by-sport allocation of the cash in the run-up to the showpiece event in London. 
 "We hope that this will now give sports the scope to find new talent as well as supporting the current elite," said BPA chief executive Phil Lane.  
 Lane added: "We can also concentrate on taking a full team to the Games of 2008 where we will need to blood new athletes who will form the bedrock of our 2012 participation." 
 In addition to the £6.5m investment, £1.5m has been made available for the pre-2008 Beijing Games preparation camps. 
 British Paralympic Performance Services have also been awarded an extra £800,000 to deliver Paralympic-specific preparation support and core services to all sports.
