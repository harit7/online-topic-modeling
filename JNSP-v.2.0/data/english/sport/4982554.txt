Rochus wins in all-Belgian final

  Olivier Rochus beat Kristof Vliegen 6-4 6-2 to win the Munich Open on Sunday in the first all-Belgian men's final in the open era.  
 Rochus, the fifth seed, broke his unseeded opponent late in the first set and then twice more in the second to clinch victory. 
 "It's just amazing for Belgian tennis," Rochus said. "It's much nicer to meet in the final than in the first round. 
 "It was just unfortunate that one of us had to lose."
