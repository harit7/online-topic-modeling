Renault interested in Schumacher

  Renault boss Flavio Briatore has admitted he would be interested in signing Michael Schumacher next year as a replacement for Fernando Alonso.  
 Schumacher's Ferrari deal expires at the end of this season and Briatore has confirmed that the seven-time world champion is on Renault's shortlist. 
 "I am looking for somebody to win races with our car," said Briatore. 
 "There are three or four guys in Formula One who can win races with our car and Michael is one of them."  
 The pair have previously worked together at Benetton, where Schumacher won his first world titles in 1994 and 1995. 
 At 37, the German is the oldest driver in Formula One but Briatore said his age would not count against him. 
 "It's like red wine - old is better," said the Renault chief. 
               
 The Italian boss is looking for a suitable replacement for current world champion Alonso, who unexpectedly announced last year that he was joining McLaren in 2007. 
 Last week, Schumacher's agent Willi Webber was quoted as saying in German newspaper Bild that Briatore had been in touch and wanted to talk. 
 "I made it clear to Flavio that we would not talk to him until Michael decides whether he wants to carry on driving or not," Webber said. 
 The German has said that if he does carry on racing, it is "99%" he will stay with Ferrari.
