Tanni will miss London Marathon

  Britain's most successful Paralympian, Tanni Grey Thompson, has pulled out of Sunday's Flora London Marathon.  
 The 36-year-old has won the London Marathon wheelchair race six times. 
 But her training schedule has been geared towards the shorter distances required for the Commonwealth Games and Visa Paralympic World Cup in May. 
 She will now commentate for the BBC on Sunday's race in which Francesca Porcellato is bidding for a third women's wheelchair win.
