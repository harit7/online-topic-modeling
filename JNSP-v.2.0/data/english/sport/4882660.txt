Scotland win world curling crown

  David Murdoch's Scotland have been crowned world curling champions after a 7-4 victory over Olympic champions Canada in Massachusetts.  
 It was 4-4 after the eighth end with Scotland taking two at the ninth but Canada had last stone in the final end. 
 However skip Jean-Michel Menard failed in a double take-out bid and Scotland clinched the title with another point. 
 It is Murdoch's first world title, coming hot on the heels of his silver last year when he was beaten by Canada.  
 But team-mate Warwick Smith was celebrating his second title, after winning in 1999. 
 Canada had actually defeated Scotland 8-2 in the first semi-final play-off, but the Scots qualified for the final after beating Norway. 
          Defeating such a big curling nation as Canada, it's colossal      Scotland skip David Murdoch        It was consolation for the Scots, who had started strongly when representing Great Britain in February's Olympics before missing out on a bronze medal after a late loss of form. 
 "That was the hardest thing ever in my life, losing that semi-final. And this just makes up for it," Murdoch said. 
 "It's something I've always dreamed about. And to do it against the best curling nation in the world, it's unbelievable." 
 The world championships threatened to be a mirror image of that after Scotland topped the round-robin, including a 7-5 defeat of Menard's Canadians, before missing out on direct qualification for the final. 
 However, a 6-4 defeat of Norway gave Murdoch a chance of revenge for defeat to 29-time champions Canada in last year's final. 
 And the Scots made no mistake as they clinched their fourth world title. 
 "Defeating such a big curling nation as Canada, it's colossal," added Murdoch. "As far as Scottish curling goes, it's huge. 
 "There's a lot of pride at stake, making sure we do ourselves justice."
