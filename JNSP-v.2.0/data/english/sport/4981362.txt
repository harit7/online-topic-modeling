 Furyk trailed leader Bo Van Pelt by three at the end of the rain-hit second round on Saturday but surged to 11 under as Van Pelt slipped back. 
 Goosen shot 65 and Immelman carded 66 to lead Van Pelt (73) by one stroke. 
 Fiji's Vijay Singh was in a group back on six under, while England's Justin Rose led Europe's charge at four under.   
 Furyk said after his round: "I'm happy to be out front at this point. 
 "I've got another round of golf tomorrow and I need to go out there and attack, to try to post one more good round." 
 Goosen is hoping for more of the same when he begins the final round. 
 He said: "On the back nine, it suddenly all came at once for me. It's nice when you know you're hitting the ball pretty good." 
 US Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman was three under after a 69 with struggling former Open champion David Duval (72) one under and Canada's Mike Weir (72), Masters champion Phil Mickleson (73) and Spain's Sergio Garcia (73) even par.
