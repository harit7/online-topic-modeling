Profile: Upul Tharanga

        FACTFILE       Born:  2/2/85, Balapitiya    Left-hand batsman     Test debut:  v India, Ahmedabad 18/12/05    ODI debut:  v West Indies, Dambulla 2/8/05        
   Despite being only a few months into his international career, Tharanga already has Test and one-day centuries to his credit.  
 He is under extra pressure to continue that form in England as a result of Sanath Jayasuriya's retirement and the absence of injured Marvan Atapattu. 
 The 21-year-old likes to score freely but may have to rein himself in as he tries to come to terms with conditions. 
 Played in 2004 Under-19 World Cup, when he hit 117 against South Africa.
