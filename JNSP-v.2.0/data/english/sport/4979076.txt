Prokopcuka wins again in Scotland

  Jelena Prokopcuka delivered a dominant display to defend her BUPA Great Edinburgh Run crown on Sunday.  
 The Latvian broke clear of the field at the halfway mark and mastered the hilly course to finish the 10km race in 32 minutes and 25 seconds. 
 Hungary's Aniko Kalovics trailed home in second 23 seconds later with Kenyan Catherine Mutwa third. 
 Tanzania's world half marathon champion Fabiano Joseph made a late surge to claim the men's title in 28.38.  
 Joseph pulled ahead of Kenyan Simon Arusei, who recovered from a fall at the 3,000m mark to finish in 28.44. 
 Defending champion Juan Carlos de la Ossa pipped Russian Vyacheslav Shabunin to the line in a sprint for third. 
 Hayley Haining was the first British woman home in 34:13 with Salford's Tomas Abyu leading the men in 29:47. 
 Ireland's Jolene Byrne had to settle for fourth place in the women's race after Mutwa's burst of speed while her compatriot Gary Murray was seventh in the men's race in in 29:40 just ahead of Abyu. 
 Prokopcuka revealed running the Boston Marathon, where she finished as runner-up, less than three weeks had made her victory in Edinburgh just that bit more difficult. 
 "I felt the effects of Boston in my legs over the last two kilometres,they became very heavy and tight," said Prokopcuka. 
 "I felt it was important to run here, as after Boston I didn't feel as tired as I expected to be. But it did hurt in the end." 
 Prokopucuka will now turn her attentions to contesting the 10,000m at the European Championships before defending her New York Marathon title in the autumn.
