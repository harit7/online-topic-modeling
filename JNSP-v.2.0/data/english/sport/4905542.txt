Hewitt to miss Monte Carlo event

  Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt has pulled out of next week's Monte Carlo Masters in order to stay fresh for the French Open at the end of May.  
 Hewitt, who led Australia into the Davis Cup semi-finals last weekend, has opted to rest instead of playing the claycourt event in Monaco. 
 Hewitt's manager Rob Aivatoglou said: "There's nothing sinister in it. 
 "What he is trying to do is to give himself the best opportunity of peaking for the important events."
