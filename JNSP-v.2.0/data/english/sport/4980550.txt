Jie wins first all-Chinese final

  Jie Zheng came out on top in the first all-Chinese final of a WTA event after Li Na retired hurt at the Estoril Open.  
 Sixth seed Jie was level at 6-7 (5-7) 7-5 when Li, who lost the 2005 final to Czech Lucia Safarova, pulled out with a pain in her right thigh. 
 The win gave Jie her second singles title on the WTA Tour. 
 She said: "I feel so sorry for Li Na but it was a good match today and I look forward to the French Open at Roland Garros (from 29 May)."
