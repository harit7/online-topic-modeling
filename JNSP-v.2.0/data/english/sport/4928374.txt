Schumi will reign again - Mansell

      By Matt Majendie        
   Former world champion Nigel Mansell believes Michael Schumacher will stay at Ferrari past the end of the season and go on to win another world title.  
 Schumacher's future has been the focus of much speculation, with Ferrari and Renault vying for his signature despite reports he could retire. 
 But Mansell, 52, told BBC Sport: "Michael will stay at Ferrari for another year, maybe two. 
 "And I believe he could go on to win one or two more world championships."  
 Mansell, who won his world title in 1992 at the age of 38, described the 37-year-old German as "a young pup" in comparison. 
 "It's wonderful what he's done at Ferrari," said Mansell, who drove for the Italian team during his Formula One career. 
          I'd put my money on Alonso (this season) - he's a star and wise beyond his years      Nigel Mansell        Schumacher is fourth in the drivers' championship this season on 11 points but 17 behind defending world champion Fernando Alonso heading into this weekend's San Marino Grand Prix. 
 The seven-time world champion's Ferrari has been plagued by engine reliability problems to date this season but Mansell said he was confident his former team would turn things around in 2006. 
 He added: "They'll get over that, no question. Ferrari are a phenomenal team and their motivation is amazingly high, as is Michael's. 
 "There's no question about his motivation in F1. Just to get into one of those cars you have to be massively motivated." 
 Despite tipping Schumacher for an eighth world title, the Englishman said it was unlikely to come this season. 
 "I'd put my money on Alonso," he said. "I think he's been a star already this year and he's wise beyond his years. 
 "I do think Ferrari will be there or thereabouts, and I thought McLaren would be a lot more competitive."
