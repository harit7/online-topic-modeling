Daly admits huge gambling losses

  Former Open champion John Daly believes he has lost as much as £33m in the last 12 years through heavy gambling.  
 Daly, 40, reveals in his autobiography he fears the problem could destroy him. 
 "If I don't get control of my gambling, it's going to flat-out ruin me," states Daly, who has been married three times and battled alcohol addiction as well. 
 The American revealed that hours after winning nearly £425,000 at the WGC-American Express last October, he lost double that gambling in Las Vegas.  
 The 1995 Open winner was defeated in a play-off against Tiger Woods in San Francisco and says he drove to Las Vegas and lost almost £900,000, mostly on slot machines - half of that in just 30 minutes. 
 The US Tour's website commissioner Tim Finchem met Daly on Monday and said afterwards: "It is clear that he continues to be concerned about and grapple with significant personal challenges. 
 "I have expressed to John the Tour's concern for his well-being, as well as his on-going need to uphold the image and standards of the PGA Tour. 
 "While we will continue to enforce the regulations and policies of the PGA Tour, I have advised John of the Tour's willingness to support him in his efforts to deal with his personal issues."
