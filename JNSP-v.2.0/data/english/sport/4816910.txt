Curlers secure Turin final place

  The Great Britain wheelchair curling team assured themselves of a medal at the Winter Paralympics with a 7-3 semi-final victory over Sweden.  
 Frank Duffy's side started strongly with three stones in the opening end and were always in control after that. 
 They will face Canada in the final on Saturday morning. 
 Meanwhile, Nathan Stephens struck an extra-time winner for the sledge hockey team as they beat Italy 2-1 to win the seventh place play-off.  
 The wheelchair curlers will be bidding to get revenge on Canada, who beat them 7-6 after an extra end in the round-robin stage. 
 "We've achieved the position we had expected to and guaranteed ourselves a medal," said team member Mick McCreadie, who celebrated his 60th birthday on Thursday. 
 "Canada will be the favourites in the final because they beat us earlier in the week so I think there is less pressure on us." 
 Skip Frank Duffy added: "We've improved our performances all through the week and there is more to come from this team in the final." 
 In the sledge hockey, GB fell behind to Italy with three minutes to go in the second period but Richard Whitehead levelled matters with just over a minute to play in the third period and Stephens' late intervention ensured the victory. 
 In the skiing, Russell Docker finished 29th in the slalom, well behind the German winner, while Sean Rose failed to finish his second run in the competition.
