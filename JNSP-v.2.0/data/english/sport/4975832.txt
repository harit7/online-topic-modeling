Players set for right of appeal

           Umpires at international level already get between 94% and 96% of decisionscorrect      ICC general manager Dave Richardson       Players are likely to be allowed to have decisions referred to the third (TV) umpire during October's ICC Champions Trophy in India.  
 The recommendation was made by the ICC's cricket committee in Dubai and is set to be ratified in July in London. 
 ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said: "Since the Champions Trophy of 2002, we have been keen to explore the possibilities offered by technology." 
 If the experiment is deemed successful it could be adapted for Test cricket.   
 Speed said: "What we have consistently sought to do is to increase the already-high numbers of correct decisions made by umpires while, at the same time, not diminishing their on-field role and authority." 
 Committee members were split down the middle on the issue, with a single vote deciding the issue. If players do not agree with the decision made by the on-field umpires they can refer it to the third umpire. 
 They can make as many appeals as they want if they are right, signalling their intent by drawing the outline of a TV with their hands, but only three unsuccessful appeals per team are allowed in each innings. 
 Technology such as Hawkeye or the Snickometer would not be used, but an lbw mat - the solid line between the stumps used by broadcasters to determine where the ball pitches and the point of impact on the batsman's pads - will be included. 
 Meanwhile, umpires will have earpieces in all international matches so they can listen to the stump microphones and the use of artificial lights during Test matches will be discontinued.
