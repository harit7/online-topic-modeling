Chinese men claim 15th team title

  China won the men's World Team Table Tennis Championships with a 3-0 victory over South Korea in the final.  
 It was the 15th title for the holders who have not been beaten in the event since losing to Sweden in 2000. 
 China lost only one individual match throughout the competition, in the semi-final against hosts Germany, for a 24-1 record in individual matches. 
 It completed a clean sweep after the Chinese women triumphed on Sunday in their final against Hong Kong.
