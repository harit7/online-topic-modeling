        FACTFILE       Born:  28/8/83, Galle    Right-hand batsman; right arm fast medium bowler     Test debut:  v Australia,  Darwin 1/7/04    ODI debut:  v UAE,  Dambulla 17/7/04        
   Widely regarded as Sri Lanka's quickest bowler, Malinga will certainly be one for English fans to watch.  
 A low slinging action can make him a handful as Adam Gilchrist and Darren Lehmann found out when he removed them in the same over of his debut Test. 
 Begins the tour with a respectable record of 54 wickets in 15 Tests at a cost of 29 runs each. 
 He will be probably be used as a strike bowler in short spells, supporting the vastly more experienced Chaminda Vaas.
