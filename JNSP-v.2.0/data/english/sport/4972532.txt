Driving ambition

  Italian downhill star Kristian Ghedina has announced his retirement from international skiing.  
 But he will still be enjoying life in the fast lane as he is embarking on a career in motor racing. 
 The 36-year-old only passed his racing driver's licence last week and is set to race at the Nurburgring. 
 He will drive in the Porsche Michelin Supercup at the Formula One European Grand Prix in Germany, with former World Rally champion Colin McRae.  
 Ghedina and Scotland's McRae are driving for the Morellato Stars Team. 
 The Italian, who recorded a World Cup record 29 podiums, is excited about his new challenge. 
 He said: "Who would have thought a few months ago, while I was still racing on the ski slopes, that I would drive a Porsche in the same team as rally legend Colin McRae at the Formula 1 weekend at the Nurburgring? This is a great honour for me." 
          After 17 years of World Cup skiing, I have to catch up a lot on the asphalt      Kristian Ghedina        
 He is also planning on racing the Morellato Porsche in Barcelona at the Spanish Grand Prix on 14 May and a BMW 320 in the Italian Touring Championship. 
 Ghedina is serious about his new career, adding: "For my first year as a driver, I will try to drive as many kilometres as possible with all sorts of cars and different circuits in order to gain experience as quickly as possible. 
 "After 17 years of World Cup skiing, I have to catch up a lot on the asphalt." 
 The charismatic Italian is not the first skier to swap his skis for the steering wheel. The former French World Cup winner Luc Alphand won this season's Paris-Dakar Rally. 
 And Scotland's Alain Baxter competed in a Peugeot 206 in the Pirelli National and Pirelli Gateshead rallies in 2003.
