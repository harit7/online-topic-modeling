Profile: Michael Vandort

        FACTFILE       Born:  10/06/78    Left-hand batsman; slow left-arm orthodox     Test debut:  Yet to play    ODI debut:  18/9/02 v Zimbabwe, Colombo       Vandort has lingered on the fringes of the Sri Lankan team since making his Test debut five years ago.  
 Now, however, his time has finally arrived with the retirement of Sanath Jayasuriya creating a vacancy at the top of the order. 
 Played in both Tests in a recent series against Bangladesh and although he made an unbeaten 64 in the first game, he was twice dismissed for nought. 
 Strongly built, Vandort prefers to get onto the front foot whenever possible.
