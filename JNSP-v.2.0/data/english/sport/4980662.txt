Barham and Molinari lead in Milan

        R3 LEADERBOARD      GB & Ire unless stated otherwise    -16  B Barham, F Molinari (Ita)   -15  P Archer   -14  N Colsaerts (Bel), S Kjeldsen (Den), B Teilleria (Fra)   Selected others:    -7  I Woosnam      England's Benn Barham shares the lead with home favourite Francesco Molinari going into the final round of the Italian Open in Milan.  
 Both players fired five-under-par 67s and are one stroke ahead of Englishman Philip Archer (68) in third. 
 Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts, Denmark's Soren Kjeldsen and Benoit Teilleria of France are a shot further back. 
 Meanwhile, overnight leader David Drysdale of Scotland is four shots off the pace after a disappointing 73.   
 Barham played on the main tour in 2003 but lost his card after finishing 150th on the Order of Merit. 
 He regained it via the Challenge Tour last season and gives part of the credit for his revival to sports psychologist John Pates. 
 Pates was banned from the European Tour for three months at the end of last season for striking a caddy at the HSBC Champions Tournament in Shanghai in November. 
 But Barham said: "I speak as I find, and he is a nice guy. Whatever he does off the course is up to him. 
 "I worked with him before at the end of 2003 and enjoyed it, and started working with him again a few months ago. 
 "He's given me a lot to work on, mainly remembering all the good shots I hit rather than reflecting on the bad ones."
