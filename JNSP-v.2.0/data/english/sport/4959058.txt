O'Sullivan dismayed after defeat

            I wish I could explain why I didn't play well      Ronnie O'Sullivan       Ronnie O'Sullivan blamed his own sub-standard performance for his 17-11 semi-final defeat at the hands of Scotland's Graeme Dott at The Crucible.  
 O'Sullivan left himself too much to do after he lost eight frames in a row to go into the final session 16-8 down. 
 "I missed too many balls, didn't make enough breaks, my safety was poor and my long-ball potting was awful," said the 30-year-old. 
 "But that's not taking anything from Graeme - he beat me comfortably."   
 The two-time champion raised hopes of a comeback when he won three successive frames to reduce the deficit. 
 But in the 28th frame Dott held his nerve after a tense and mistake-ridden 27 minutes to win it on the black. 
               "I don't know what would have happened in the final session had I found my gears," said O'Sullivan. 
 "At 16-8 I thought that was it all over, but when he came out and started missing ball after ball then I thought I had a chance. 
 "If I could have found a gear then you never know. To be honest, if Graeme had played as well as he had done in the other sessions then maybe I would have won just one frame. 
 "I wish I could explain why I didn't play well. I suppose we're just human beings." 
 O'Sullivan explained the problem he had been having with his tips that led to the Essex star pulling one off his cue during the 14th frame. 
 "I've murdered the tips recently," he added. 
 "I had about seven in the week coming into the tournament and about eight on this week - I just couldn't find the right one." 
 The two-times world champion also revealed why he gave away his cue at the end of the match to a member of the Crucible crowd. 
 "I gave it to the young lad because I'll be playing with a new one next season."
