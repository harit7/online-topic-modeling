Tiger left to regret missed putts

  Tiger Woods saw a host of chances go begging on Sunday as American rival Phil Mickelson won his second Masters.  
 Woods was superb from tee to green but could not convert nearly enough of the many chances he created to put pressure on front-runner Mickelson. 
 "It was frustrating," said Woods. "If I would have just putted normal I would have given Phil a bit of trouble. 
 "I lost it out there on the greens. I'll probably go snap this putter in about eight pieces."  
 The world number one's scoring was steady when it needed to be spectacular on Sunday. 
 "I putted atrociously. As good as I hit it, that's as bad as I putted," the 30-year-old said. 
 "I felt so in control of my ball tee to green, the best I've hit it in years, and when I got on the greens, I was an idiot." 
 The four-time Masters champion, who still has never won a major in which he was not leading after 54 holes, was playing with concerns about his 74-year-old father Earl, too weak to leave home because of cancer, at the back of his mind. 
 "I'm sure he's watching and is probably a little mad at me for the way I putted," Woods said. 
 Mickelson, meanwhile, has now won the last two majors on offer, and at least one in each of the last three years. 
 The 35-year-old Californian, who for so long was considered incapable of delivering when it mattered, is now perhaps the greatest obstacle in the way of Woods' pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles.
