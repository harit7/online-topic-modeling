Profile: Thilan Samaraweera

        FACTFILE       Born:  22/9/76, Colombo    Right-hand batsman; right arm off-spin bowler     Test debut:  v India,  Colombo 29/8/01    ODI debut:  v India,  Sharjah 6/11/98        
   When he began his international career, Samaraweera was seen as a spin bowler who could contribute a few useful runs.  
 All that changed when he made 103 not out in his first Test and he has maintained that form to the extent that he boasts an average in the mid 40s. 
 The 29-year-old is the middle order sheet anchor, a role he played to perfection for over eight hours in making 142 against England in 2003. 
 Sri Lanka hope he can produce something similar in English conditions.
