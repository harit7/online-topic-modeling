Last-frame drama sends Hendry out

  Nigel Bond clinched a thrilling 10-9 win over Stephen Hendry after potting a re-spotted black at the Crucible.  
 Bond led 6-3 overnight and made it 7-3 only for his Scottish rival to win the next five frames for an 8-7 advantage. 
 The first-round match eventually went down to the final frame, Bond sinking the black but then going in-off to leave the scores tied at 48-48. 
 With the nerves starting to jangle, Englishman Bond sank the respotted black to beat the seven-time champion.  
          Stephen has given me a few pastings and it's payback time      Nigel Bond        
 Afterwards, Bond said even he was shocked by the way that he gained revenge for his defeat by Hendry in the 1995 final. 
 "Some incredible matches crop up at the Crucible every now and again and this was another," he said. 
 "I'm just delighted to be on the winning side. Stephen has given me a few pastings and it's payback time. 
 "I was shaking when I potted the black the first time. As soon as I hit the shot I knew the white was going in." 
 Hendry was literally speechless after his five-frame winning streak in the middle of the match failed to see him through to the second round. 
 In the post-match news conference he spoke two sentences. 
 Asked if it was a cruel way to lose he replied "I suppose", before ignoring a question about his performance and just shrugging when he was asked about the table. 
 When asked where this defeat ranked among others in his career, he responded "Along with all the rest."
