Nadal extends his winning streak

  Rafael Nadal extended his unbeaten run on clay to 43 matches with a 6-4 6-2 win over Feliciano Lopez in the second round of the Barcelona Open.  
 The defending champion broke twice in each set against his fellow Spaniard to set up a clash with another compatriot - qualifier Ivan Navarro-Pastor. 
 His winning sequence is now just three behind second-placed Bjorn Borg on the all-time list. 
 Albert Costa postponed his retirement by beating Dominik Hrbaty 6-3 7-5.  
 Costa will quit tennis when he is knocked out of the event. 
 Nadal said: "I know from experience that the first two rounds are verydifficult. 
 "I know that if I can win the first two rounds then it gets a bit easier after that." 
 Fellow Spaniards Juan Carlos Ferrero, Tommy Robredo, Ivan Navarro Pastor and Alberto Portas also won their second-round matches. 
 Second seed Nikolay Davydenko lost 6-7 (7-9) 7-5 6-4 to giant Croatian Ivo Karlovic, who pounded down 19 aces.
