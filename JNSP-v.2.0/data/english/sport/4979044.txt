Drivers want qualifying changes

  Drivers' representatives will meet with team bosses next week with proposals to tweak the new qualifying rules.  
 At present, the 10 drivers who get through the first two stages must start the race with whatever fuel they had at the beginning of the final session. 
 That means drivers spend the first part of the final session burning off fuel before setting quick laps at the end. 
 Toyota driver Jarno Trulli said: "We feel it is not good enough now. The drivers all feel the same about it."  
 F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone said changes could be made if teams agreed unanimously with the proposals. 
 "We could have these 10 drivers going out one at a time for a single flying lap like last year," he said. 
 "If all the teams agree, it can be done from the next Grand Prix." 
 Scotland's David Coulthard, in his role as a director of the Grand Prix Drivers Association, will represent the drivers in the meeting. 
 The current knock-out format, introduced this year, eliminates six drivers after each of the two 15-minute sessions before a final bid for top-10 places.
