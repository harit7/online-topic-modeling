Briatore confident over F1 deal

  The dispute over Formula One's future could be resolved this weekend, says Renault boss Flavio Briatore.  
 Rebel manufacturers Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Honda and Renault have yet to sign a new commercial deal with F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone. 
 But Briatore said after a meeting with Ecclestone: "I'm sure we will sign the agreement with Bernie to 2012." 
 Grand Prix Manufacturers Association teams have submitted entries to the 2008 championship and beyond.  
               
 The GPMA teams have agreed to act together so Ecclestone's offer of 60% of commercial revenue to the teams will be either accepted or rejected outright. 
 Ferrari, Williams, Red Bull, Scuderia Toro Rosso, Midland and Super Aguri have already agreed to the terms.
