Parrott out as Dott eases through

  Former world champion John Parrott has been knocked out of the World Championship at the first hurdle after Graeme Dott wrapped up a 10-3 win.  
 Dott, who reached the final in 2004, led 7-2 overnight with the help of breaks of 98, 50, 56, 80 and 57. 
 When play resumed, Dott's break of 61 put him further ahead although 1991 champion Parrott pulled one back after edging a tight 11th frame. 
 But the end soon came for Parrott as Dott won the next two frames.  
 Parrott insists he will not be quitting the sport but could need to win two qualifying matches to book a place at the Crucible again. 
          I will keep playing next season, I'll dust the cue off because I still love to play and compete      John Parrott        
 "The day before I came here I practised for two hours and never missed a ball, but in the match I could hardly pot one," he said. 
 "I've never felt so nervous apart from when my children were born, I think because of the expectation and added pressure due to hitting the ball so well before I came. 
 "I was never in control of what I was doing and never got off the ground. I was even thinking at 6-0 I could be whitewashed and it's not a nice feeling to be given an ironic cheer when you finally win a frame. 
 "These days I can't sustain my concentration for long periods and if I'm on a break of 40 or 50 I know a bad shot is coming up. I just throw people a lifeline. 
 "But I will keep playing next season. My ranking won't be too bad and I'll dust the cue off because I still love to play and compete." 
 Dott, beaten by Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final two years ago, will now play Stephen Hendry or Nigel Bond in the second round. 
 "I thought I played well in the first session and it's given me a lot of confidence because my form had not been good in practice and I was a bit worried," he said.
