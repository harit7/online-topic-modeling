Freitas claims fourth world title

  Brazil's Acelino Freitas won the vacant WBO lightweight title with a split decision over Zahir Raheem.  
 Freitas used his jab, overhand right and cleaner punching to claim the fourth world title of his career. 
 The judges scored the fight 115-113 and 116-112 for Freitas. One judge had Raheem winning 115-113. 
 Freitas, who has been touted as an opponent for British world champion Ricky Hatton, reclaimed the title he lost to Diego Corrales in 2004.  
               
 Corrales declined a mandatory defence of the title against Freitas and was stripped of the belt. 
 American Raheem earned the right to fight for the title with an impressive unanimous decision over Mexican great Erik Morales in October. 
 On the undercard, Andre Ward, America's only gold medallist at the 2004 Olympics, stopped Andy Kolle at the end of the sixth round in a middleweight bout. 
 Oakland's Ward is now undefeated in nine fights since turning professional.
