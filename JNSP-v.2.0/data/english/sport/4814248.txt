Arthur to defend titles in April

  Super featherweight champion Alex Arthur is set to defend his European, British and Commonwealth titles on 29 April at Meadowbank Stadium, Edinburgh.  
 The 27-year-old, who beat Ricky Burns last month, has not lined up an opponent for his home town fight yet. 
 But Arthur is happy to be making a swift return to the ring. 
 He said: "The main aim for me this year is to keep busy with four or five fights, hopefully, culminating in a world title fight."  
 Arthur has also issued a ringside invite to world super-middleweight Joe Calzaghe after being mightily impressed with the Welshman's victory over Jeff Lacy. 
 He added: "I was mesmerised by Joe's performance against Lacy - that, to me, was the best performance I have seen anywhere. 
 "I have always said he was the best fighter in Britain and now he has proved it and is definitely in the top 10 pound-for-pound best in the world. 
 "Joe's a big inspiration to me and it was an honour to fight on the same card as him when he defended his title at the Royal Highland Showground. I said to him then he would beat Lacy if they ever met. 
 "I would love for him to be ringside and I know that him being there would bring something extra out of me."
