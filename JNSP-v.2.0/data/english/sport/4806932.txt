GB curlers set up key USA clash

  The GB wheelchair curling team need to beat the USA in their last pool game on Wednesday to have a chance of reaching the Winter Paralympics semi-finals.  
 They beat Italy 8-5 before a narrow 7-6 extra-end loss to Canada dented their hopes of a place in the last four. 
 The sledge hockey team beat Italy 2-1 and will next meet Sweden on Wednesday as they play-off for 5th-8th place. 
 In the skiing events, Sean Rose and Russell Docker finished 22nd and 23rd respectively in the Super-G event.  
 Trailing 5-3 going into the fifth end against Canada, the GB curlers had a chance to take five stones but only managed three. 
 The Canadians claimed one stone in the final end to level the match and then skip Chris Daw came up with a big shot to seal victory. 
 "Overall I'm delighted with the way the team played. It was a great performance. We dug deep but came back well," said GB skip Frank Duffy. 
 Against the Italians in the morning session, GB trailed 4-0 after two ends but came up with five stones in the next end to put them back in control. 
 The sledge hockey side recovered from heavy defeats to Canada and Norway to claim a hard-fought win over the host nation Italy, who had around 4,000 supporters cheering them on. 
 Ian Warner played a captain's role, scoring early in the second period before the Italians equalised soon after. 
 But Karl Nicholson was on the mark for GB three minutes before the end of the period, and there were no more goals in the third period. 
 "It was a tough match and we are delighted to have secured our first win in the competition," said Warner. 
 "The performance was below what we were hoping for but we will be looking to improve in our next match against the Swedes."
