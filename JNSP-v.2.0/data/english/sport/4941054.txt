Collazo confident for Hatton bout

  Luiz Collazo has accused Ricky Hatton's camp of taking him too lightly ahead of their fight in Boston on 13 May.  
 WBA welterweight champion Collazo, 24, said: "They're looking past me, but they picked the wrong guy. 
 "I'm a slick southpaw." claimed the American. "Styles make fights, and I'm the exact wrong style for Hatton. 
 "He's one of the best at 140lbs but he's moving up to 147 and it's a whole new ballgame. If he wants to bang we'll bang - it's going to be a great fight."  
 Hatton is stepping up a division from light welterweight to challenge Collazo. 
 The American, who has won 26 of 27 fights, earned his title last April and has defended it once. 
 Hatton has given up his IBF light welterweight title to fight Collazo rather than mandatory challenger Naoufel Ben Rabah. 
 The Manchester fighter still holds the WBA light welterweight belt.
