Khan lines up Hungarian challenge

  Rising star Amir Khan has lined up former European lightweight title challenger Laszlo Komjathi as his seventh professional fight.  
 Khan, who won a silver medal in the 2004 Olympics, will fight the 30-year-old Hungarian at Belfast's King's Hall on 20 May. 
 "Komjathi is a test for me and it's at the right time," said Khan. 
 "He's had a lot more experience at championship level than the other boxers I've fought."  
 Komjathi, who has won 24 of his 35 professional fights, took Italian Stefano Zoff the distance in a European lightweight title fight two years ago. 
          This will represent another step up for Amir in his ring education      Promoter Frank Warren        
 More recently he was stopped in the 10th round by Giuseppe Lauri, who is taking on Junior Witter for the European light welterweight title later this month. 
 And his second paid fight was against DeMarcus Corley, who is set to meet Witter for the vacant WBC crown later this year. 
 Khan, who is unbeaten in six professional fights and has five knockouts, said: "Komjathi has fought some good solid names like Lauri and Zoff and, early in his career, Corley. 
 "I've watched some videos of him and he's a strong, powerful, boxer with an attacking style so I know that I won't have to go looking for him. 
 "I'll be looking to bring him onto my punches and know that I've got the power to knock him out." 
 Promoter Frank Warren said: "Komjathi has been in with some good fighters who have gone on to become world champions or high-level operators at world level. 
 "This will represent another step up for Amir in his ring education."
