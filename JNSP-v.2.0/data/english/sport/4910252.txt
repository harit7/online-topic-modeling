Profile: Jehan Mubarak

        FACTFILE       Born:  10/1/81, Washington    Left-hand batsman; right arm off-spin bowler     Test debut:  v Bangladesh,  Colombo 28/7/02    ODI debut:  v South Africa,  Johannesburg 27/11/02        
   Originally named in the squad as cover, Mubarak's place was confirmed when captain Marvan Atapattu withdrew because of a persistent back injury.  
 He now faces the challenge of trying to win a regular place after a stop-start international career thus far. 
 A first-class average of under 30 suggests he has plenty of work to do despite an elegant batting style. 
 Mubarak is undoubtedly top-class as far as fielding is concerned and was once a national swimming champion.
