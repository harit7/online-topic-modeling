Cooke retains top Belgium title

  Great Britain's Nicole Cooke made a successful defence of her Fleche Wallonne title as she claimed a hat-trick of wins in the Belgium race.  
 The Welsh star, who celebrated her 23rd birthday last week, held off a late charge from former world champions Judith Arndt and Trixi Worrack to win. 
 Australian Oenone Wood took the lead halfway up the final ascent. 
 But Cooke reeled in the double World Cup winner before holding off the challenge of Germans Arndt and Worrack.
