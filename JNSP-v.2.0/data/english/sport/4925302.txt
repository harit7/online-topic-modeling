Tiger puts father's health first

  Tiger Woods is to take an indefinite break from golf as his father Earl continues his battle against cancer.  
 The world number one did not put a timeframe on his return but said he would play at the US Open in June. 
 "It's kind of up in the air with the situation back home, so I don't know what's going to happen," he said. 
 "My father is hanging in there, he's an absolute fighter and walking miracle," added the American, in New Zealand for the wedding of caddie Steve Williams.  
 Woods is likely to want to play again before the US Open at Winged Foot, New York, which begins on 15 June. 
 He will be seeking his 11th major, having finished three shots off the pace of winner Phil Mickelson at the Masters earlier this month.
