Cooke forewarns World Cup rivals

  Wales' Nicole Cooke has fired a warning to her World Cup rivals by claiming she is back to her best.  
 Cooke is the new leader of the World Cup series after the Univega Raleigh Lifeforce star finished fifth in the fifth stage in Berne, Switzerland. 
 "After two knee operations - one on each leg - I feel over my injury problems, which is very reassuring," Cooke told BBC Wales Sport. 
 "I've settled well with my new team and I'm back to the good old ways."  
 Cooke leads the standings by 14 points from Nurnberger Versicherung racer Oenone Wood of Australia. 
          I'm happier having the jersey on than being the one trying to make up the difference      Nicole Cooke        
 Wood finished second behind Bigla rider Zoulfia Zabirova of Kazakhstan in the Tour de Berne, with Russia's Olga Slyusareva third and T-Mobile's German star Judith Arndt fourth. 
 The race came just six days after 23-year-old Cooke won the Fleche Wallonne for the third successive time. 
 Injuries have prevented the Wick rider from contesting the World Cup title since she became its youngest winner back in 2002. 
 But with those problems behind her, Cooke now feels confident she can hold on to the winner's jersey for the remaining seven races. 
 She said: "Considering I crashed out in New Zealand leg of the World Cup and didn't score any points I'm really happy at this stage. 
 "I hope that with every stage I can gradually increase my lead and take it all the way to the end of the season. 
 "I don't really see it as pressure because I guess it's harder for the people playing catch up. 
 "I'm happier having the jersey on than being the one trying to make up the difference." 
 The next round is the Gran Premio Castilla y Leon on 7 May.
