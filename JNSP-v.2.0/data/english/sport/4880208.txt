O'Sullivan to miss Dublin event

  Sonia O'Sullivan has been forced to pull out of Sunday's Great Bupa Ireland Run in Dublin.  
 O'Sullivan is still troubled by the hamstring injury which ruled her out of last month's Commonwealth Games. 
 Ethiopia's Meselech Melkamu has been added to the women's entry, fresh from claiming two bronze medals at the World Cross Country Championship in Japan. 
 "Melkamu jumped at the opportunity to compete and clearly is in great shape," said race director Matthew Turnbull.  
 "On paper given her current form she must start as favourite, but let's remember after her exertions in Fukuoka, she might be a little on the tired side after her efforts." 
 Melkamu finished fourth in last summer's World Championships 5,000m final just12 months after winning the world junior gold medal over the distance. 
 Turnbull added: "It's great to have her step into O'Sullivan's shoes but Sonia, although not running, is coming along to start the junior event at the meeting." 
 Despite Melkamu's outstanding talent, she will have to be wary of defending champion Amy Rudolph of the United States, who outsprinted O'Sullivan in a brilliant finish in last year's race. 
 Fernanda Ribeiro and Sally Barsosio, the former Olympic and World 10,000m champions from Portugal and Kenya are also in the field, while Jolene Byrne - third last year - will carry Irish hopes.
