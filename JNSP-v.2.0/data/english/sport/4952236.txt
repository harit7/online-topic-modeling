Maze impresses in Punchestown win

        WHITEWATER CHAMPION STAYERS' HURDLE       1 Asian Maze  8-13 fav  R Walsh (T Mullins)    2 Kerryhead Windfarm  100-1  A McNamara (M Hourigan)    3 Fire Dragon  12-1  D Russell (J O'Neill)       Asian Maze cruised to victory in the Whitewater Champion Stayers' Hurdle at Punchestown on Thursday.  
 Ruby Walsh took the 8-13 favourite to a four-and-a-half length win over 100-1 outsider Kerryhead Windfarm, with Fire Dragon in third. 
 Asian Maze has been cut from 10-1 into 8-1 for next year's Champion Hurdle with VC Bet. 
 "Ruby thinks she is not a staying mare but a Champion Hurdle mare," said trainer Thomas Mullins.   
 "She always sticks to her task. It's grand that we have at least six to eight months to think about where we want to go with her." 
 Meanwhile, Michael Hourigan was thrilled with Kerryhead Windfarm's return to form. 
 "I'm very pleased and I may train him for the World Hurdle next season as he stays and likes fast ground," said Hourigan. 
 "Going back over fences would be an option but he seems to jump better over the smaller obstacles and we know he's a good horse." 
 Asian Maze has gone from 8-1 to 6-1 for the World Hurdle.
