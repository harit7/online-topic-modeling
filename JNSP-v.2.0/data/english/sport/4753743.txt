FA Cup flashback

  Saturday's FA Cup final, the last to be played at Cardiff, sees Liverpool, who won the first FA Cup in Cardiff in 2001, take on West Ham, who lost the first Wembley final in 1923.  
 Having returned to the Premiership this season after a two-year absence, West Ham have defied expectation, finishing in the top 10, claiming a European place and reaching their first FA Cup final since they beat Arsenal 1-0 in 1980. 
 Liverpool, on the other hand, have lifted the Cup four times since then, most recently in 2001. The only previous cup final meeting between the teams was in the League Cup final in 1981. 
 Ray Stewart's late penalty to equalise Alan Kennedy's goal gave West Ham a 1-1 draw at Wembley, and a replay at Villa Park. 
 Paul Goddard's goal put West Ham in front, before Kenny Dalglish levelled and Alan Hansen's header went in off Billy Bonds' knee to win the cup for Liverpool. 
 BBC Sport catches up with the players and managers taking part that night in Birmingham.
