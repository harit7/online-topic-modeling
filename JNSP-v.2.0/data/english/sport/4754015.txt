PDC events get prize money boost

  Prize money on the Professional Darts Corporation circuit will be increased to a total of £2m in 2007.  
 All five major PDC events, plus the Holsten Premier League Darts, will have prize fund rises over the next year. 
 The PDC has also announced a 25-event Pro Tour, beginning in January 2007 with a £500,000 prize fund on offer. 
 PDC chairman Barry Hearn said: "We are showing our commitment to the players for their hard work. Every Pro Tour event will be worth a minimum £20,000."  
 Total prize money for PDC events was £1.09m in 2005. 
 It rose to £1.2m in 2006, and will be £1.5m in 2007, with the Pro Tour pot adding a further £0.5m.
