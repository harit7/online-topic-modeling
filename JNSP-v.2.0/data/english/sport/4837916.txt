Williams and Skelton to go again

  Danny Williams and Matt Skelton have agreed to a rematch at Manchester's MEN Arena on 15 July.  
 Commonwealth heavyweight champion Williams took a split decision against British champion Skelton last month. 
 The winner could go on to fight for a world title later this year, according to promoter Frank Warren. 
 Russia's WBA champion Nikolay Valuev, who will defend his title on 3 June, has been touted as the most likely world-title opponent in the past.  
 Williams and Skelton will return to action in separate non-title bouts at the York Hall, Bethnal Green, on 1 April.
