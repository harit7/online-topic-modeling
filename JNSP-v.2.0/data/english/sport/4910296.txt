Profile: Nuwan Zoysa

        FACTFILE       Born:  13/05/78, Colombo    Left-hand batsman; left-arm fast medium bowler     Test debut:  v New Zealand,  Dunedin 7/3/97    ODI debut:  v New Zealand,  Christchurch 25/3/97        
   Zoysa is a talented, but inconsistent performer whose progress has been hampered by a series of injuries.  
 The selectors still have faith in his ability, although there was little in his performance on the 2002 tour to England to recommend him for a recall. 
 He has been recalled to the squad after taking 26 wickets in nine games during Sri Lanka's domestic season. 
 Now 27, there may not be many more chances for the well-built left-armer unless he delivers this time.
