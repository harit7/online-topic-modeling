Hatton camp upbeat over title bid

      By Ben Dirs        
   Ricky Hatton's promoter is confident his fighter's clash with America's Luis Collazo in Boston on 13 May will be for the WBA welterweight crown.  
 Collazo's promoter, Don King, admitted a WBA sanction was still needed amid claims his boxer is legally bound for a defence against German Oktay Urkal. 
 But Dennis Hobson said: "There are one or two procedures to go through but we're pretty confident it'll be sorted. 
 "We signed with Don King to fight for the WBA title and the onus is on him."  
 King won the purse bid to stage Collazo-Urkal but the fight never came to fruition. 
 The bout was set to take place on 1 April, but King claimed Urkal was unable to obtain a US visa.

 Hatton has brought his own legal baggage into the fight with Collazo. 
 In February, he gave evidence at a court case in New York in which his former promoter Frank Warren sued the WBA for $3m. 
 Warren claims his boxer Souleymane M'Baye was entitled to fight Carlos Maussa before Hatton beat him to claim the WBA light welterweight title last November. 
 In addition, M'Baye, the WBA's mandatory light welterweight contender, served an injunction against Hatton preventing him from fighting anybody but himself, but has since withdrawn it. 
 "The WBA can't stop Ricky fighting altogether," said Hobson. "That's restriction of trade."
