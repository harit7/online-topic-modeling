  Beginner's guide  
   Wheelchair curling, which makes its debut in Turin, follows the same rules as its Olympic counterpart, except no sweeping is permitted and each game is played over six ends rather than 10. 
 The object of the sport is to slide smooth granite stones across the ice towards a target (the house), marked on opposite ends of each sheet. 
 Each team must include at least one woman and is made up of four players with each athlete delivering two stones alternating with the opposing team. 
 The objective is to reach the 'house', which is marked by four large concentric different coloured circles. The team that places the most stones closest to the centre of the house wins the point.

  Beginner's guide  
   The alpine skiing events include downhill, super-G (super giant slalom), giant slalom and slalom. 
 Athletes with a physical disability will compete either sitting on a sit-ski or standing using one or two skis and poles depending on the nature of their disability. 
 Athletes who are blind or partially sighted compete with a guide who skis either beside or behind the competitor while providing verbal instruction on slope and direction. 
 Paralympic events use a specifically devised classification criteria to mediate between the different disabilities, but in all competitions, the winner is the one who, without missing any gates, records the lowest time over the course.

  Beginner's guide  
   Ice Sledge Hockey is the version of traditional ice hockey for athletes with a lower limb disability. 
 Players use specially designed sledges fitted with two blades to propel themselves across the ice and have two playing sticks, which they use like a ski-pole to push themselves and to shoot the puck. 
 There are five players (two defenders and three attackers) and one goaltender, with no limit on the number of substitutions, but a total of 15 players is allowed in each team. 
 The periods are shorter than for ice hockey, with three of 15 minutes length, and the object of the game is simply to score more goals than the other team.
