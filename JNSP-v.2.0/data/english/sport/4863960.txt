Coulthard blasts Montoya rumours

  David Coulthard has hit back at claims he could be replaced at Red Bull Racing next year by Juan Pablo Montoya.  
 Coulthard was dumped by McLaren in favour of Montoya at the end of 2004 and reacted angrily to rumours he will again be ousted by the Colombian. 
 Montoya has been linked to various teams since McLaren confirmed Fernando Alonso was joining them in 2007. 
 And Coulthard said: "He's just got to shut up and get on with it. I can't comment on rumours, only on fact."  
 Coulthard insists his McLaren record outshines Montoya's when compared with number one driver Kimi Raikkonen. 
 "The statistics show that, relative to Kimi, he has not done as well as I did there," said the 35-year-old Scot. 
 "In the absence of any other information, that is what it boils down to. 
 "I know that McLaren use this type of information to make decisions and he has simply not done anything remarkable." 
          One year in, Montoya has had a clear indication from McLaren that they are not that impressed      David Coulthard        
 While Raikkonen won seven races last year and finished overall runner-up, Montoya won three and ended the season in fourth place - although the Colombian did hand his team-mate at least two further races because the Finn was in title contention. 
 Montoya also missed two races after an accident in training. 
 Coulthard said: "He is in a position where he's got to make noises. He's got to look to the future, that is understandable. 
 "It may well be at Red Bull and may well be somewhere else. 
 "But one year in, Montoya has had a clear indication from McLaren that they are not that impressed."
