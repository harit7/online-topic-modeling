GB begin with wins in Manchester

  Great Britain's mens and womens wheelchair basketball teams both made a successful start to the Visa Paralympic World Cup in Manchester.  
 The men battled hard to beat Sweden 54-49 with Terry Bywater top-scoring on 27 points. 
 The women's side claimed two victories, first overcoming China 45-28 with 16 points from Sally Wager. 
 They then had a narrow 29-28 overtime victory over Spain with Ann Wild clinching it with a single free throw.  
 Spain had rallied from 25-12 down going into the final quarter to force the game to overtime while Wager again led her side with 11 points. 
 The men face a tough schedule on Tuesday against Athens Paralympic gold and silver medallists Canada and Australia knowing they must improve to have a chance of victory. 
               
 Bywater admitted: "It wasn't the best of performances against Sweden but we got the win. However, we have got to cut out the individual mistakes." 
 The women face Mexico in their final pool game hoping to make it three wins out of three.
