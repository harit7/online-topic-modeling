Wie signs up for US Open attempt

  Michelle Wie's name is among a total of 8,584 entries for the 2006 US Open at Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, New York.  
 The 16-year-old will enter a local qualifier for the second major of the golf season in Hawaii on 15 May. 
 If successful there she advances to a sectional qualifier in New Jersey, where she will try to become the first woman to make the USGA's premier event. 
 Seventy golfers, including eight past champions, are exempt from qualifying for the 15-18 June tournament.  
 Wie tried to reach the US Open in 2005 but failed to advance beyond the local qualifier after she tied for sixth. 
 The American teenager, however, has ruled out attempting to qualify for golf's oldest major, the Open Championship. 
               
 Despite rules changes which have opened the door to women entrants, Wie says there is no room in her schedule for an outing at Royal Liverpool. 
 While Wie worries about qualifying, defending champion Michael Campbell, two-time champions Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and world number one Tiger Woods will all be out to add to their past US Open titles with the benefit of their exemptions. 
 Phil Mickelson is also spared qualifying as he seeks to add to his Masters crown. 
 The youngest name in the hat is 13-year-old Ryan Simpson while the oldest is Ordean Olson, 76. 
 Just to prove you can be golf by name and by nature, there are seven applicants named Chip, 15 Greens and nine Woods. 
 To confuse matters further, there are three Tigers in the hunt - Tiger Helgelien, Tiger Godwin and a certain Mr Woods.
