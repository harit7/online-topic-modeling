Athletics footwear: high jump shoes

  
  The high jump shoe has a much thicker sole.  
 It gives maximum support and comfort for this physically demanding event. 
 It will be light and flexible helping you to get that speed over a short distance before the jump. 
 The spikes in the shoe are all important - the front spikes help you gain speed in the run-up. 
 And the four spikes in the heel provide the grip when you take-off.
