   Bandara has seen off the likes of Upul Chandana and Rangana Herath to become Sri Lanka's main spin bowling back-up for Muttiah Muralitharan.  
 His international career really took off after he played county cricket for Gloucestershire last summer, taking 39 wickets in seven Championship games. 
 Since then he has played Tests against India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. 
 But he proved more effective in the one-day VB Series in Australia, twice taking four wickets in an innings.
