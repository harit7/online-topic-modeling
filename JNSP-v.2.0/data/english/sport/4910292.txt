Profile: Nuwan Kulasekara

        FACTFILE       Born:  22/7/82, Nittambuwa    Right-hand batsman; right arm fast medium bowler     Test debut:  v New Zealand,  Napier 4/4/05    ODI debut:  v England,  Dambulla 18/11/03       Kulasekara marked his international debut with two wickets as England were skittled for 88 at Dambulla in 2003.  
 Has the reputation of being steady rather than spectacular, but can move the ball off the seam and occasionally produce some reverse swing. 
 Those skills could make him useful as Sri Lanka look to exploit pitches, which are likely to favour seamers. 
 Has a highest score of 95, but has so far done little of note with the bat at international level.
