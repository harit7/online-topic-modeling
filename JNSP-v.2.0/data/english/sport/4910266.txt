Profile: Kumar Sangakkara

        FACTFILE       Born:  27/10/77, Matale    Left-hand batsman; wicket-keeper     Test debut:  v South Africa,  Galle 20/7/00    ODI debut:  v Pakistan,  Galle 5/7/00        
   Adam Gilchrist and, more recently, Mahendra Singh Dhoni may grab more of the headlines, but Sangakkara's record shows he is a top-class keeper/batsman.  
 Still only 28, he has scored almost 9,000 runs in Tests and one-dayers and averages 47 in the five-day game. 
 More than 300 dismissals behind the stumps can be added to that record, although his back-chat has been known to rub batsmen up the wrong way. 
 He also played for the ICC one-day World XI in last year's Super Series.
