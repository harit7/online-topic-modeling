 They then went down 68-35 to Australia later on in their final group match. 
 Meanwhile, GB women, who beat China and Spain on Monday, wrapped up their group games with a 46-34 defeat to Mexico.

 The British men's team, who beat Sweden 54-49 on Monday, remained upbeat despite their defeats on Tuesday. 
               British player Joe Bestwick, 21, said: "It was a much-improved display than the one against Sweden. 
 "We tried a few different things and it was only a 16-point game against the best in the world."
