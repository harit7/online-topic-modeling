Kindred in record-breaking form

  Paralympic champion Sascha Kindred warmed up for the Visa Paralympic World Cup with a new world record in the S6 200m IM at the British Championships.  
 Kindred, who this year joined the Leominster swim club, knocked a second off his previous best to lower the standard to two minutes 47.46 seconds. 
 It followed up his British record in Saturday's S6 50m butterfly event. 
 "I've been doing well in training where I've had a lot of endurance work and it seems to be coming together," he said.  
 The 28-year-old added: "I knew I was swimming well after my butterfly event, so I decided to give it a go but to go a second inside the old record was amazing and I'm delighted. 
 "To go a whole second inside the old record was amazing - I'm so chuffed." 
 Liz Johnson from Swansea clocked 48.04 seconds for a new European record in the SB6 50m breaststroke category while there was also a European mark of 31.16 for James Crisp in the S9 backstroke. 
 Daniel Pepper claimed three British records in the S14 50m breaststroke, 100m breaststroke and 200m IM. 
 Athens Paralympians Anthony Stephens and Robert Welbourn set new British marks in the S5 50m freestyle and S10 200m individual medley. 
 There were also British records for Rachael Latham (S8 100m butterfly), Chris Pugh (S14 100m butterfly), Kate Arnold (SB8 50m breaststroke), Ben Proctor (S14 50m backstroke), Katie Grey (S9 50m backstroke), Sarah Timms (S7 50m butterfly) and Matt Whorwood (S6 200m freestyle).
