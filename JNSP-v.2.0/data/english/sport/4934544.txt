You rate the players

   We are changing the way we compile our Player Ratings.  
 In fact, we are not compiling them anymore. You are. 
 Our new user-generated Player Rating service will be making its debut at Saturday's FA Cup final between Liverpool and West Ham. 
 And the new addition to the BBC Sport team will be an ever-present during all 64 matches at this summer's World Cup finals in Germany. 
 The process is simple. You submit your marks out of 10 for the players on show at any stage during the game, or after the final whistle has blown. 
 The aggregated scores, based on all submitted entries, will be displayed in our live console and updated as more scores come in. 
 We also want your opinion on the big talking points from the games. 
 So, at various stages of the match, we will be asking for your verdict on issues such as who will win, whether a goal should have been ruled out, or a penalty awarded. 
 As part of our development process, we want you to rate the players during this weekend's FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium. 
 Rate the players, then tell us what you think of our new bit of kit. 
  The FA Cup final player rater will be available shortly before kick-off on Saturday. Revisit this story or the main football index to access the application.
