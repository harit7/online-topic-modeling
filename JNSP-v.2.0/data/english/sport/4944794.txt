Ullrich well adrift on comeback

  Former Tour de France champion Jan Ullrich made a low-key return to competitive action in the prologue of the 60th Tour de Romandie in Geneva.  
 In his first race for eight months after injury, the German was 90th of 163 riders, finishing 26 seconds behind winner Paolo Savoldelli of Italy. 
 Despite hitting a barrier just before the line, Savoldelli timed four minutes 27 seconds for the 2.11-mile lap. 
 Spain's Alejandro Valverde was 0.64 seconds back in second place.  
 Ullrich is using the race to prepare for the Tour de France but admitted he had work to do after the delay to his season because of an inflammed knee. 
 "I have a lot to catch up," said the 32-year-old. "I've never started the season so late." 
 The prologue course for the 60th Tour set the riders some challenges with its twisting nature. 
 "It was fun to ride after so long," Ullrich said. "I didn't go all out on this very technical course." 
 Savoldelli, who will wear the race leader's yellow jersey in the 169km first stage around Payerne in the north-west of Switzerland, was pleased with his performance. 
 "I've been training hard in recent weeks and so my form is pretty good," he said. 
 "Like many riders I'm already thinking about the Giro but this is a prestigious race and so I'm going to give it everything to try and win it."
