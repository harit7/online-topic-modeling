Newmill lands Punchestown prize

        KERRYGOLD CHAMPION CHASE       1 Newmill  5-4 fav  A J McNamara (J J Murphy)    2 Fota Island  9-4  A P McCoy (M Morris)    3 Central House  6-1  R Loughran (D Hughes)       Queen Mother Champion Chase winner Newmill claimed a runaway succeess in the Kerrygold Champion Chase at the Punchestown Festival on Tuesday.  
 John Murphy's horse, the 5-4 favourite ridden by Andrew McNamara, repeated his success over Fota Island and Central House, who trailed him at Cheltenham. 
 "He did not jump as well as he did at Cheltenham but he has a fierce engine," said jockey McNamara. 
 The race was the highlight of the first day of the four-day meeting.   
 Tony McCoy and JP McManus, thwarted in the previous race as Iktitaf stormed away from odds-on favourite Straw Bear in the VC Bet Champion Novice Hurdle, settled for second again on the 9-4 shot Fota Island. 
 Central House was also well beaten in the end, finishing the two miles in third place at 6-1. 
 "He is a gift of a horse and has such a high cruising speed," said happy trainer Murphy said. 
 "He usually jumps well, although he had a couple of scares today. But maybe it was the whole expanse of the course as there are no running rails in places. 
 "He loves to bowl along but you would be surprised if you dropped him in how well he settles. 
 "We will play it by ear but we may step him up in trip next season and he could well go to the King George. It is 50-50 whether he stays at two miles or runs over further. We will just have to see how the summer goes."
