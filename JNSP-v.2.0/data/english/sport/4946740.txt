Funding boost for young talents

  Five of Britain's most promising athletes have had their lottery funding increased by UK Athletics.  
 Natasha Danvers Smith, Jessica Ennis, Germaine Mason, Martyn Rooney and Rhys Williams have all been rewarded. 
 But UKA performance director Dave Collins warned that the five were not expected to peak this summer. 
 He said: "No-one is more aware than me that people are looking for good results, but it's Olympic outcomes that I am interested in."  
 Collins again warned that established athletes would have to perform to their potential to retain their places at the highest levels of funding. 
 He said: "We are moving to a smaller, more focused programme. 
 "The athletes know that there are several who need to rise significantly to the challenge this summer if their status is to be retained."
