Letham retains indoor world title

  Scotland's Margaret Letham retained the WIBC Women's World Indoor Singles title with a 9-3 11-7 victory over England's Carol Ashby in Belfast.  
 But 19-year-old Andrew Barker, from Elgin, failed to make it a Scots double when he lost the men's final to Nicky Donaldson, of Guernsey, 8-3 4-9 2-0. 
 Letham, from Blantyre, eased through the first best-of-nine-end set then came back from 7-1 down in the second. 
 She said: "I was very focused and determined, more than my semi-final."  
 Letham added: "I knew I would have to play a whole lot better, because Carol is one of the world's best lady bowlers."
