Clarke pulls out of Houston Open

  Darren Clarke withdrew from the Houston Open after Thursday's first round to return home to be with his wife Heather who is battling cancer.  
 Clarke pulled out of the event after firing a four-under-par 68 which had left him two shots behind early clubhouse leader Stuart Appleby. 
 His manager Andrew Chandler said Clarke had taken the decision following his wife's latest test results. 
 "Following ongoing tests, he has decided to return home," said Chandler.  
 Clarke pulled out of several events late last year because of his wife's illness. 
 The Northern Ireland golfer notched six birdies and two bogeys in his round.
