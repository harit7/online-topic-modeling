Wie loses form after landmark cut

  Hawaiian teenager Michelle Wie finished tied for 35th after completing her first men's event at the Asian Tour's SK Telecom Open in South Korea.  
 Wie made the halfway cut for the first time on Friday but heavy rain reduced the event to just three rounds. 
 She struggled with her control and accuracy in the final round, carding a two-over 74 to finish on three under. 
 "Strong winds made it difficult out there," Wie said. "I wasn't satisfied but I kept going and hitting away."  
 Wie had made a positive start, sinking two birdies over the first three holes. 
 But when her tee shot went out of bounds on the fourth, she lost her momentum and dropped a shot before losing ground with three more bogeys. 
 Wie carded previous rounds of 70 and 69 but finished 12 shots behind eventual winner Prom Meesawat from Thailand. 
 The SK Telecom is Wie's eighth men's event and she will now set her sights on qualifying for the US Open later this month.
