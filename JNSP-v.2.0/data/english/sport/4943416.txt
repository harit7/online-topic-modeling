Design wizard joins BMW F1 team

  Former Williams chief designer Joerg Zander is joining Formula One rivals BMW Sauber in the same role on 1 July.  
 The 42-year-old German left Williams in March for personal reasons but will become Sauber's head of design at the Hinwil factory in Switzerland. 
 "His experience will be an important asset to us," BMW team boss Mario Theissen explained on Tuesday. 
 Zander joined Williams from BAR in September 2005, having spent three years with Toyota from 1999.
