Athletics footwear: javelin shoes

  
  The javelin shoe comes in for some pretty rough treatment.  
 The feet are often dragged along the ground and so a stronger and longer-lasting material is often used to overcome this. 
 Because of the pressure on the feet and legs, support is crucial. 
 This shoe will usually look more like a boot, with protection around the ankle. 
 Extra strapping around the foot is also sometimes provided to minimise the movement of the foot within the shoe.
