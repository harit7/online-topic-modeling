Profile: Tillakaratne Dilshan

        FACTFILE       Born:  14/10/76, Kalutara    Right-hand batsman; right arm off-spin bowler     Test debut:  v Zimbabwe, Bulawayo 18/11/99    ODI debut:  v Zimbabwe, Bulawayo 11/12/99       Attacking batsman, useful spin bowler and occasional wicket-keeper, Dilshan's versatility makes him an important member of the Sri Lanka squad.  
 He burst onto the international scene with an unbeaten 163 against Zimbabwe in his first Test series. 
 Initially struggled to build on that positive start, but in recent years has improved his consistency and now averages just under 40 in Tests. 
 Technically sound, Dilshan can be exciting to watch when in the mood.
