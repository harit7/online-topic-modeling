Honda failings frustrate Button

  Jenson Button did not try to hide his disappointment after a frustrating weekend at the European Grand Prix ended in his retirement from the race.  
 The Briton's Honda was sluggish in qualifying and then suffered engine failure on lap 29. 
 "That was a disappointing end to a tough weekend," said Button. "The car was inconsistent through the race. 
 "I had a big loss of power, the engine tightened and so I had to pull over. Let's hope for better in Barcelona."  
 Button had shrugged off his sixth place finish in qualifying, even though it was the first time he had not lined up in the top three of the grid all season. 
 The Honda driver hoped the team's strategy on race day would pay off but after climbing to fourth place on the opening lap, he fell to fifth before his engine died. 
          Both our cars suffered from a lack of pace      Gil de Ferran  Honda sporting director        
 Button left the Nurburgring track before the end of the race and was frustrated not to at least cross the line. 
 "I got a strong start and had a good tussle with Kimi Raikonnen before I got ahead of him to take fourth," said Button. 
 "In my second stint it was starting to come good as the fuel came down and I would have been happy to finish fifth with a car I wasn't happy with and just get four points. 
 "Instead I lost a lot of drive and that was it. Some of it was down to the wind but the balance just wasn't there really." 
 Honda team-mate Rubens Barrichello battled to his best result of the season as he came home fifth, although he also complained about the car's balance. 
 Sporting director Gil de Ferran vowed to get to the bottom of his team's shortcomings before next weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. 
 "We will be analysing our performance in great detail with a view to finding some improvement going into the next round," he said. 
 "Rubens battled hard but both cars suffered from a lack of pace."
