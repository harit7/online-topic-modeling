Defar breaks Radcliffe road mark

  Ethiopian Meseret Defar shattered the 5,000m road race world record, shared by Paula Radcliffe and Tirunesh Dibaba, with a stunning win in Carlsbad.  
 The Olympic 5,000m champion eclipsed the old mark by five seconds with a new time of 14 minutes and 46 seconds. 
 Radcliffe had set the record in 2003 with victory in the Flora Light Women's Challenge in Hyde Park before Dibaba equalled it in Carlsbad last year. 
 Defar's win comes one month after she defended her world indoor 3,000m crown.  
 Turkey's Elvan Abeylegesse is the world 5,000m world record holder on the track with a time of 14.24:68.
