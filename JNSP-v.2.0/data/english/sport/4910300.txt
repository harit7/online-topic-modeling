Profile: Muttiah Muralitharan

        FACTFILE       Born:  17/4/72, Kandy    Right-hand batsman; right arm spin bowler     Test debut:  v Australia,  Colombo 28/8/92    ODI debut:  v India,  Colombo 12/8/93       The arguments about Muralitharan's bowling action will probably continue for as long as he chooses to continue playing the game.  
 But there is no escaping the fact that he is a cricketing phenomenon. 
 The first spinner to reach 500 Test wickets, and now with over 600 to his credit, he has taken five in an innings on no fewer than 51 occasions. 
 He bowled Sri Lanka to an innings win at The Oval in 1998 and remains the main threat to England's batsmen.
