    The Great Britain women's wheelchair basketball team had to be content with silver at the Visa Paralympic World Cup in Manchester.  
 The side battled hard against Mexico but eventually their opponents' experience made a difference as they came away with a 37-22 win. 
 Great Britain trailed 14-12 at half-time but Mexico outscored them 8-2 early in the second half and from then on never lost the lead 
 Sally Wager top-scored for Great Britain on seven points with five points apiece from Clare Strange and Caroline Matthews. 
 Despite the defeat, captain Ann Wild was pleased with the team's displays at the event. 
               
 "We knew Mexico would be tough but I think we did a very good job in the tournament as a whole with some rookies on the team," she said. 
 "The silver medal is a reward for the passion and pride we put into our performances this week." 
 Coach Garry Peel acknowledged that the team's poor shooting had played a big part in the defeat. 
 "Defensively, I think we did a really good job but we just couldn't score, which is a problem with this team. 
 "Hopefully I will have the chance to go and work on that whenever we get together for our next training session. 
 "We only had three or four training sessions before this tournament and overall I'm delighted with the effort the team put in." 
 Earlier the GB men's team clinched bronze after a 51-34 victory over Sweden.
