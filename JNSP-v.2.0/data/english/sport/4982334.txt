Clijsters powers to Warsaw title

  World number two Kim Clijsters won her first title of 2006 with victory over Svetlana Kuznetsova at the J&S Cup in Warsaw on Sunday.  
 The Belgian condemned fourth seed Kuznetsova to a third successive final defeat in Warsaw with a 7-5 6-2 win. 
 After breaking in game 11, Clijsters then saved two break points on her way to closing out the opening set. 
 Second seed Clijsters broke four times in the second set and clinched her 31st career title on the third match point.  
 "She's a very, very good clay-court player," Clijsters said. "I was very aggressive and tried not to give her the opportunity to play her own game. 
 "I think I built up my points really well and was patient until I felt like I could go for a winner. 
 "I was very consistent throughout the whole match, and we have some really good rallies out there which makes it a lot of fun. I was really enjoying myself out there." 
 Kuznetsova said: "Kim hit the ball and I was defending, but after a good shot I was not coming in. 
 "I was giving her too much space, and she could hit her winners."
