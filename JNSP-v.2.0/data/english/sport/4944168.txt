Ferrer ousts Murray in Barcelona

  Andy Murray's challenge for the Barcelona Open title ended at the second-round stage when he was beaten 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 1-6 by David Ferrer.  
 Unlike in his opening match when he fought back from a set down, the Briton started well against fifth seed Ferrer from, Spain, ranked 12th in the world. 
 But having been edged out of a second set tie-break, the 18-year-old Scot capitulated in the deciding set. 
 Ferrer's reward for victory is a match with Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka.  
 Murray's defeat mirrored his exit from the Monte Carlo Masters Series a week earlier when he also won the first set. 
          This is my best performance on clay ever by a long way and shows I'm not a bad clay player      Andy Murray        
 He had a chance to wrap up the match when serving at 6-5 in a fluctuating second set but was broken to love. 
 He then lost the tie-break 7-4 and was broken early in a deciding set in which he never threatened. 
 "This is my best performance on clay ever by a long way," enthused Murray. 
 "It shows that I'm not a bad clay player. Ferrer's a top five on the clay behind Nadal, Federer and some other guys. 
 "I could have had him, but he played better in the tie-break."
