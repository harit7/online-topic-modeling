Garzelli opts not to ride in Giro

  Former winner Stefano Garzelli has pulled out of the Giro d'Italia to focus on this year's Tour de France.  
 The Liquigas rider, who won Sunday's 190km Round the Henniger Tower event in Frankfurt, was victorious in his home tour in 2000 and runner-up in 2003. 
 He will ride in Tours of Luxembourg on (31 May-4 June) and Switzerland (10-18 June) ahead of Le Tour (1-28 July). 
 The Giro begins on Saturday, 6 May, with four days of racing in Belgium before heading to Italy.  
 Reigning champion Paolo Savoldelli is tipped along with 2004 winner Damiano Cunego, 2003 champion Gilberto Simoni and Danilo Di Luca who finished fourth last year. 
 Ivan Basso, the Tour de France runner-up last year behind Lance Armstrong, is also a big favourite to win the Giro's pink jersey.
