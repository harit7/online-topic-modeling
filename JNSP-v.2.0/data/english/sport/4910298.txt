Profile: Farveez Maharoof

        FACTFILE       Born:  7/9/84, Colombo    Right-hand batsman; right arm fast medium bowler     Test debut:  v Zimbabwe,  Harare 6/5/04    ODI debut:  v Zimbabwe,  Harare 25/4/04       Maharoof has established himself as a regular member of Sri Lanka's Test and one-day sides, primarily operating as a new ball or first change seamer.  
 He has ambitions, however, to be recognised as an all-rounder and was a prolific run scorer at schoolboy level. 
 Maharoof has produced his best Test performances in both disciplines this year, taking 4-52 against Pakistan and hitting 72 against Bangladesh. 
 Could be a threat with the ball if he adapts well to English conditions.
