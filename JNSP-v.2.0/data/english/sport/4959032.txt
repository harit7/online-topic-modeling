Lewis-Francis sixth on comeback

  British sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis finished sixth in his first 100m race since the Commonwealth Games.  
 Lewis-Francis, who was disqualified in the semi-finals in Melbourne, ran 10.42 seconds in the Penns Relays meeting. 
 The event was won by world record holder and Commonwealth gold medallist Asafa Powell, who clocked 10.10secs. 
 Harry Aikines-Areetey, the World Youth 100m and 200m champion, finished 0.01secs behind Lewis-Francis, who is staying in the US for training.  
 Afterwards, former UK performance director Max Jones warned against expecting too much from Aikines-Areetey too soon. 
 "Harry is an excellent prospect but there are several teenage sprintersaround who are as good or even better," said Jones. 
 "Harry's one saving grace is that his coach, Matt Favier, is levelheaded,knows athletics inside out and will hopefully, keep Harry's feet firmly on thestarting blocks."
