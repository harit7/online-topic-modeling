Ballack has no doubt over Chelsea

  Germany captain Michael Ballack has confirmed he will leave Bayern this summer and said he had "no doubt" he would be moving to Chelsea.  
 The 29-year-old midfielder, who is out of contract in the summer, told German Pay-TV channel Premiere: "The time hascome for me to make this move. 
 "When I came to Bayern in 2002, general manager Uli Hoeness told me 'when you're 29, you can still move abroad'. 
 "I rejected a very attractive offer from Real Madrid at the time."  
 Ballack is preparing for his last match for Bayern against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday and will enjoy the title celebrations afterwards, even if the crowd continue to jeer him. 
 "The whistles are welcome because they prove I have performed well here and have been an important player," he added. 
 "The contract offer they made me proves that too." 
 Ballack has said will name the club he intends to join before the World Cup finals, which start on 9 June. 
 He has reportedly held talks with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho regarding a move to the Premiership champions. 
 He has played in Germany for all of his career but is keen on a move abroad. 
 In April, the Germany captain spoke on the subject of a possible transfer to Chelsea and stated: "There have been serious talks. Nothing has been signed yet but I know what I want. 
 "I always wanted to play abroad at some stage. This is the last chance for me to do this." 
 It has been reported that Ballack asked Mourinho for a guaranteed place in the first team but the Chelsea boss has refused, causing the potential transfer to stall.
