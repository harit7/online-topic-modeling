Myskina stunned by Radwanska win

  Former French Open champion Anastasia Myskina was beaten in the first round of the J&S Cup in Warsaw by Polish teenager Agnieszka Radwanska.  
 The 17-year-old battled to a 6-4 4-6 6-4 win over Russia's 2004 Roland Garros champion. 
 "The win was a huge surprise for me," said Radwanska, who won the junior Wimbledon crown last year. 
 Mysinka was less thrilled saying: "It's the beginning of the clay-court season and so nothing really bad happened."  
 She added: "I think she was a little luckier than me. Some of her shots were unbelievable and really close to the line." 
 Radwanska broke the sixth seed in the third set and survived a break point at 5-4 before a Myskina error on deuce in the next game gave her match point. 
 The Pole, ranked 309th in the world, hit a forehand winner to seal victory. 
 Ninth seed Daniela Hantuchova and fifth seed Francesca Schiavone made progress, with Hantuchova beating Anna Smashnova 4-6 7-5 6-3 and Schiavone thrashing Emma Laine 6-0 6-1. 
 Ukrainian qualifier Julia Vakulenko set up a meeting with top seed Kim Clijsters with a 6-4 6-1 win over Swiss Emmanuelle Gagliardi. 
 Serbia's Ana Ivanovic beat Poland's Marta Domachowska 6-4 7-5 and will now face second seed Patty Schnyder. 
 Venus Williams, who won the title in 2004, will be action on Wednesday in her first appearance since the Australian Open.
