Norfolk claims Florida hat-trick

  Peter Norfolk clinched his third straight quad singles title at the Florida Open with a tense 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-3) win over American David Wagner.  
 Norfolk's marathon three-hour victory over Wagner will help the Paralympic champion close the gap on world number one Wagner in the rankings. 
 "Wagner was playing really well and I'm pleased to have toughed it out in the tie-breaker," Norfolk said. 
 The Briton will be back in action at the Japan Open in May.  
 On Saturday, Wagner teamed up with Nick Taylor to beat Norfolk and his American partner David Jordan 6-2 6-1 to the doubles crown in Boca Raton.
