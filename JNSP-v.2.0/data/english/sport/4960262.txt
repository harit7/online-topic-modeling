Morris staves off plucky Munroe

  Manchester's Andy Morris defended his British featherweight title with a unanimous points decision over Rendall Munroe in Edinburgh.  
 However, the Leicester fighter made life awkward for the champion from the first round to the last bell. 
 The early rounds were cose but Munroe was almost stopped in the eighth after a big right hand from Morris. 
 The champion stepped up the pace but could not finish off Munroe, who was still punching back in the final round.  
 Afterwards, the 23-year-old Munroe admitted he was unhappy with his performance. 
 He said: "It was a hard and tough fight but I made him look better than he was. No offence to Rendall but he couldn't get out of second gear. 
 "My timing was out and I was getting caught with shots that I never get caught with. I've got a lot more to show, but all respect to Rendall."
