Agassi plans to return at Queen's

  Andre Agassi will make his comeback after three months out at the Stella Artois Championships at London's Queen's Club from 12-18 June.  
 The 36-year-old American has chosen to skip the clay-court season to ensure he is in good shape for Wimbledon. 
 "The wear and tear of the clay-court season is something that has set me back in the past in terms of the grass-court season," said Agassi. 
 "The grass is something that I don't want to miss again."  
 Agassi last played a competitve match at the beginning of March but, in what could be his final year on tour, he is being especially careful with his fitness. 
 The Las Vegan has missed Wimbledon for the last two years because of injury. 
 At Queen's club he will line up alongside Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Lleyton Hewitt, Ivan Ljubicic and Britons Andy Murray, Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. 
 "The Stella Artois is a very important and traditional tournament and I like a lot to play on grass," said Nadal. 
 "I need to improve, I want to improve, and to be able to stay in London and play on grass before Wimbledon is a very good opportunity for me." 
 The Spaniard played the Halle tournament in Germany last year, losing to Alex Waske in the first round, and went down to Gilles Muller in the second round of Wimbledon two weeks later. 
 Roddick said: "I have some fond memories of the Stella Artois over the last few years and I look forward to going back to defend my title. 
 "I always enjoy going to such a special place to play on grass." 
 Murray made a breakthrough at last year's tournament, beating Santiago Ventura for his first ATP Tour victory and then seeing off Taylor Dent. 
 The Scot's run came to an end in a dramatic third-round encounter with Thomas Johansson.
