GB curlers suffer mixed fortunes

  The Great Britain wheelchair curling team suffered a mixed day at the Winter Paralympics with a win and a loss in their latest round-robin matches.  
 The team suffered a narrow 7-6 loss to Norway in the morning before recovering to defeat Sweden 7-2. 
 It means the team are in a four-way tie for third place as they bid to reach the semi-finals. 
 In the skiing, Liz Miller finished well down the field in 16th in the women's super-G standing event.  
 Great Britain made a good start against the Norwegians, who are one of the surprise packets of the tournament, going 3-0 up after the first end. 
 The Norwegians responded with four stones in the next end but although GB levelled the match at 4-4, Norway stayed ahead after that 
 GB upped their game against Sweden and, after taking an early 2-0 lead, they controlled the match to run out comfortable winners. 
 "This morning's defeat was a bit of a hiccup," said team member Tom Killin. 
 "We weren't expecting Norway to be as good. But we were more pleased with this afternoon and we need to win our last three games to have a chance of a medal." 
 GB face Italy on Tuesday morning before a crucial match against Canada, who have only lost one of their four games so far, in the afternoon. 
 Elsewhere on Tuesday, the GB sledge hockey team play Italy in their final group match which will decide who finishes third and fourth in the pool. 
 In the skiing, both Russell Docker and Sean Rose will be in action in the super-G event.
