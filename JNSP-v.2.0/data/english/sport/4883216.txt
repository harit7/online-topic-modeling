Walker claims new freestyle mark

  Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Matt Walker set a new S7 world best in the final of the multi-disability 50m freestyle at the British Championships.  
 Walker clocked 28.54 to lower the S7 previous best of 28.58 set by British team-mate David Roberts in 2000. 
 "I can't believe it, but why couldn't I do it last month at the Commonwealth Games?" said the Marple Paralympian. 
 "My training's been broken over the last two weeks so to do that off that kind of preparation is pretty amazing."  
 He added: "My coaches Colin Hood and Neil Parsley have been doing a really good job with me in training and I now aim to bulk up a little more and improve on my speed." 
 Walker returns to action in next month's Visa Paralympic World Cup in Manchester where he will compete in the S7 freestyle.
