Day romps through to second round

  Ryan Day picked up where he left off to beat Joe Perry 10-3 in the first four frames of Thursday's evening session.  
 Perry trailed 7-2 overnight, and the writing looked on the wall when Day took the first frame, however Perry replied by taking the next. 
 Day won the 12th to move within a frame of round two despite Perry's 61 break. 
 Perry was on course for 9-4 until a slip let in the Welshman to wrap things up before the mid-session interval and set up a clash with Ronnie O'Sullivan.  
 Afterwards, Day was already looking forward to his next match against O'Sullivan. 
 "If you had a choice you wouldn't go for Ronnie but that's the way the draw is," he said. 
 "I'll have to make a good start and see how it goes from there. 
 "Joe didn't play as well as he can, but I felt I had more to give and was really focused on getting the match finished." 
 In contrast, Perry was looking at where his first round challenge had gone wrong. 
 "I don't know if you can practice too hard but I left all my form on the practice table", he said. 
 "I made a lot of unforced errors and you can't afford to miss pots against anyone," he added. 
 "Ryan got more confident as I missed and ran away with it. It was all my own doing."
