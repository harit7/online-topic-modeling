Aberdeen to host 2011 Walker Cup

  Royal Aberdeen, the world's sixth-oldest golf club, has been awarded the 2011 Walker Cup.  
 David Hill of the Royal & Ancient Club said the course, formed in 1780, would provide "a fitting showcase for amateur golf's premier match". 
 Royal Aberdeen hosted the Senior British Open last year. 
 The USA regained the Walker Cup in Chicago last August and will defend the trophy at Royal County Down in Northern Ireland next year.
