Radcliffe upbeat after operation

  World record-holder Paula Radcliffe has had surgery on the foot injury which forced her to miss the Commonwealth Games and the London Marathon.  
 The 32-year-old now believes the niggling injury, which she sustained in January, will finally heal. 
 She said: "I had surgery last week to remove the neuroma and thickening on the nerve that was bothering me. 
 "It went well and should give me no more trouble. It had to be removed as it wouldn't have settled on its own."  
 Radcliffe, whose London Marathon crown was taken by Deena Kastor on Sunday, is now targeting the 10,000m at the European Championships in Gothenburg in August. 
 Her next marathon is more likely to be Chicago or New York in the autumn where she could meet Kastor. 
 "With many more goals and hopefully years of racing ahead, I don't want to do anything to jeopardise this," she added. 
 "Although I'm gutted not to be able to race, I have to be sensible and let my body get on with the healing process. 
 "Looking on the bright side, I know that often from frustration and disappointment like this comes a strength that often surprises me once I get back training and racing."
