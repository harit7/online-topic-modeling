Safin powers through in Estoril

  Marat Safin wasted little time in reaching round two of the Estoril Open with a comprehensive win over Italian qualifier Fabio Fognini.  
 Safin continued the long road back after a serious knee injury with a 6-1 6-4 victory on the clay. 
 The Russian, ranked 49 in the world, will play second seed and compatriot Nikolay Davydenko in the last 16. 
 Top seed David Nalbandian of Argentina was in mixed form but went on to beat Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 7-5 7-5.  
 Nalbandian, a champion in Estoril in 2002, was broken early on in both sets but the unseeded Mahut's weak serve allowed the Argentine back in. 
 Despite his win in Estoril, Safin said he was struggling with a lack of confidence after being sidelined for seven months by a knee injury. 
 "I'm having trouble getting my confidence back," said Safin. "But I'm working hard and trying to do it. 
 "I'm here, I'm trying to play and win as many matches as possible. 
 "Against Fognini there was so much wind, it was tough. I was lucky to win in straight sets." 
 Spanish former champion Carlos Moya showed glimpses of his old form as he beat Brazilian Flavio Saretta 6-3 6-4. 
 French teenager Gael Monfils also got on track with a 6-1 6-2 win over Romanian Razvan Sabau.
