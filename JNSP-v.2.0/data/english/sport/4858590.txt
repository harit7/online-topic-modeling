Clijsters keen to play in Fed Cup

  Kim Clijsters will play through the pain of arthritis to represent Belgium against Russia in the Fed Cup.  
 The world number two said on Wednesday she would be "delighted" to play alongside Justine Henin-Hardenne. 
 "I'll be doing everything I can to be fully fit in Liege on 22 and 23 April, when we'll send Belgium into the semi-finals," she told her website. 
 "If all goes well I'll then try to hold on to that form all the way to Roland-Garros (French Open)."  
 Clijsters suffered a surprise second-round loss to American Jill Craybas in the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami on Saturday. 
 Her former coach Marc Dehous went public to say she should consider taking a year out of tennis to get over her injury troubles. 
               
 But Clijsters hit back saying: "It doesn't seem to be the right solution, knowing that my arthritis is not going to disappear overnight." 
 "Despite losing in Miami, I'm very satisfied with my season so far. 
 "I won in Hong Kong, reached the semi final of the Australian Open and got to the final in Antwerp."
