Kastor eyes date with Radcliffe

  London Marathon winner Deena Kastor could take on Paula Radcliffe later this year if the 33-year-old American decides to run in Chicago or New York.  
 "I thrive on competing against the best," said Kastor, who became the fourth-fastest woman to win in London. 
 "I need to think about whether I go for an even faster time, or compete against a stellar field." 
 She added: "I'm pretty sure a full marathon will be on the cards: either Berlin, Chicago or New York."  
 Kastor was second in the Berlin half-marathon earlier this month and significantly made an inspection of the full marathon course there. 
 She also won the Chicago Marathon last October. 
 "I will take a couple of weeks to reflect on my next goal - I haven't discussed what's next for me yet," said Kastor. 
 Radcliffe, who pulled out of the London Marathon with a foot injury, is expected to race again in August, when she could defend her European Championship 10,000m title. 
 But the Briton could then race an autumn marathon - with Chicago or New York obvious contenders.
