China men defend world team crown

  China's men completed a straightforward 3-0 whitewash over Denmark to retain the Thomas Cup in Toyko.  
 World number one Lin Dan immediately went on the attack with an array of smashes at the net as he defeated Peter Gade 21-17 21-19 to put China 1-0 up. 
 Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng then came from behind to beat doubles world number one pairing Jens Eriksen and Martin Lundgaard Hansen 19-21 21-11 21-18. 
 Bao Chunlai wrapped it up with a 21-12 12-21 21-12 win over Kenneth Jonassen.  
 The defeat left Denmark still searching for their first win in eight appearances in the Thomas Cup final. 
 Despite the margin of victory, Lin, who was beaten by Gade in the China Masters six weeks ago, said the Dane was far from an easy opponent. 
 "Both of us played really well," Lin said. "We were both fighting for our countries. 
 "I'm glad that I won this important match. When I lost to Peter in Beijing he played better but I prepared well for this match." 
 The triumph by the men's team saw China complete a double in the world team events following the women's victory in the Uber Cup on Saturday.
