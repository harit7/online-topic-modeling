Davis grinds past qualifier Hicks

  Six-times champion Steve Davis battled into the second round at the Crucible with a 10-4 win over Andy Hicks.  
 The 48-year-old took a 6-2 lead into the final session but that was reduced by two as his 32-year-old opponent from Devon mounted a fightback. 
 But that was cut short by the 'Nugget' winning the 11th and very scrappy 12th to put himself within touching distance of victory. 
 Davis won the mistake-filled 14th frame to set up a meeting with Shaun Murphy.  
 "I quite enjoyed the match," said the 48-year-old. 
 "I was even able to laugh at some of the shots I missed and the crowd were laughing too." 
 The six-time champion will now face the defending champion Shaun Murphy, who beat him in last year's quarter-finals. 
 "I'm looking forward to playing Shaun," Davis added. "I love the way he plays but I'd love to turn him over. I will go in there and play aggressively."
