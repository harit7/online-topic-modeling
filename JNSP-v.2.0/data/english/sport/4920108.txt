Rusedski may skip Davis Cup tie

  Greg Rusedski has not decided whether he will play in Great Britain's next Davis Cup tie against Israel in July.  
 The Europe/Africa Zone play-off match clashes with the RCA Championships in Indianapolis, in which 32-year-old Rusedski reached the semis last year. 
 The British number two would lose valuable ranking points if he missed the tournament. 
 He told BBC Sport: "I'd like to be there but it's a big decision and I'll have to sit down and think about it."  
 However, Rusedski is hoping to boost his world ranking over the grasscourt season in order to minimise the impact of possibly missing the tournament in the United States. 
               
 Speaking in a question-and-answer session for BBC Five Live and the BBC Sport website, Rusedski added: "If I do well at Queen's and Wimbledon, it takes the pressure off and makes the decision easier." 
 Rusedski has carried on playing Davis Cup despite compatriot Tim Henman's decision to end his participation in the competition at the beginning of last season. 
          I've asked Tim about six times to play Davis Cup again and I'm 0 for 6      Greg Rusedski        
 Without Henman, Britain lost a relegation play-off against Serbia & Montenegro earlier this month and now cannot get back into the World Group until at least 2007. 
 Rusedski added: "I've asked Tim about six times to play Davis Cup again and I'm '0 for six', so I don't think I'm going to win that battle. 
 "He's got a family and two young children and he's slowing down his career. He's just happy where he is at the moment and you have to respect that."
