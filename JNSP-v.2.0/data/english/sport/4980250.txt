Clijsters too good for Dementieva

  Top seed Kim Clijsters continued her smooth progress at the J&S Cup in Warsaw with victory over Elena Dementieva in the last four.  
 Clijsters dropped serve twice early on but recovered to beat the third seed 7-5 6-4. 
 "I'm very excited with the way I've been playing," she said. "I knew from the start it was going to be tough." 
 Svetlana Kuznetsova strolled past fellow Russian Anna Chakvetadze 6-1 6-1 in Saturday's second semi-final.  
 "I feel so confident," said Kuznetsova. 
 "I'm not saying I'm going to win because I have a tough opponent - number two in the world and always hard to play - but I feel so different, like a much better player."
