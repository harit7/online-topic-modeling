Lee eases to Welsh Open victory

  Stephen Lee overcame world champion Shaun Murphy 9-4 to win the Welsh Open at Newport.  
 It was a fourth world ranking title for Lee, who set up the victory by winning the first four frames. 
 Murphy recovered his composure and was only 5-3 behind by the mid-session interval. 
 But Lee regained the initiative in the evening session, winning the opening frame 88-0, and he maintained his advantage to emerge victorious.  
 "I lost my concentration at 4-0 and I was lucky Shaun missed the black to make it 4-4," Lee said. 
           Lee held his nerve and his win was well deserved    From AM       
 "It wasn't an easy black but I expected him to pot it. In the end I'm pleased that I brought out glimpses of my best form. That's encouraging for the rest of the season." 
 Murphy was appearing in only the second ranking tournament final of his career and was philosophical in defeat. 
 "It was my first time playing in Wales so it wasn't a bad week," he said. "It's just a shame I couldn't finish the job off. 
 "I had some good results but you're judged by what you do on the day and I wasn't good enough in the final."
