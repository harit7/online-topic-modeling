Latvian to defend Edinburgh title

  Jelena Prokopcuka is set to defend her BUPA Great Edinburgh title on 7 May.  
 The Latvian just missed out on winning the Boston Marathon over the Easter weekend but plans to be back in action in less than three weeks. 
 Prokopcuka will renew her rivalry with Derartu Tulu for the 10km road race in the Scottish capital. 
 Tulu, a two-times Olympic 10,000m gold medallist, was forced to withdraw from the Boston event, won by Rita Jeptoo, with a stomach virus.  
 Prokopcuka remained upbeat despite her defeat to Jeptoo in Boston over the final mile. 
 "The last two miles, I thought I could do it," said Prokopcuka, chasing a third successive marathon win after wins in Osaka and New York last year. 
 "But I didn't. Rita was very competitive and I did all I could." 
 Matthew Turnbull, elite athletes director of the Edinburgh meeting, expects Tulu to recover from her injury. 
 "I'm sure she'll be fit to renew acquaintances with Prokopcuka in what should be another tough battle," he said. 
 Spain's Juan Carlos de la Ossa will be aiming to repeat his success in the men's event.
