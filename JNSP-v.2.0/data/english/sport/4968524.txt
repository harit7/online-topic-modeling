Webster given Ballesteros boost

  Britain's Steve Webster has been buoyed by praise from Seve Ballesteros ahead of his Italian Open title defence at Castello di Tolcinasco near Milan.  
 The Warwickshire 31-year-old worked on his short game with Ballesteros at last week's Spanish Open, and the golfing legend was impressed by what he saw. 
 "He told me I'm good enough to contend, even in the majors," Webster said. 
 "So I know I have to get my head down and try to win a couple of times in Europe and get into the world top 50."  
 Webster ended a 10-year wait for his maiden European Tour win when he romped to a three-stroke victory in Italy 12 months ago. 
 "I am a little disappointed I have not kicked on since winning last year," he admitted. 
 "I have made a lot of top-20 finishes but I have to convert them into top fives and top 10s so I am in contention to win." 
 The favourite this week is world number 25 Angel Cabrera, who won last year's BMW Championship at Wentworth. 
 The big-hitting Argentine arrives in Italy in good heart after finishing tied eighth at last month's US Masters. 
 Edoardo Molinari is likely to receive a hero's welcome when he tees up in his home Open for the first time since becoming the first European to win the US Amateur championship since 1911. 
 Emanuele Canonica and former Ryder Cup player Costantino Rocca lead the challenge for a first home victory since Massimo Mannelli in 1980.
