Festival unveils Best Mate statue

  A life-size bronze statue of triple Cheltenham Gold Cup hero Best Mate has been unveiled at Prestbury Park.  
 The late champion's owner Jim Lewis, trainer Henrietta Knight and Cheltenham racecourse chairman Lord Vestey were among those at a special ceremony. 
 Lewis said: "This is a fitting tribute to a much-loved racehorse. 
 "He is here where he belongs, where everyone can gaze upon his beauty and his grace and remember his three Gold Cup victories."  
 Knight added: "It is a very moving moment in the history of Cheltenham. We watched this bronze being made when Best Mate was alive. Philip Blacker has done a wonderful job." 
 Best Mate, winner from 2002 to 2004, missed last year's race after breaking a blood vessel and died when making his seasonal reappearance at Exeter in November. 
 He is the fourth horse to be honoured in bronze at Prestbury Park. The others are triple Gold Cup victor Arkle, five-times winner Golden Miller and Dawn Run, winner of the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup.
