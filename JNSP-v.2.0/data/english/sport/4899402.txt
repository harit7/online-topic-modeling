O'Sullivan unsure over Gothenburg

  Sonia O'Sullivan has yet to decide whether to compete in this summer's European Championships in Gothenburg.  
 The 36-year-old Irishwoman said she would assess her track form before finalising her plans for the season. 
 "If I can get myself fitter and do a few more races, I might make it," said O'Sullivan who missed the Commonwealth Games because of a hamstring injury. 
 O'Sullivan was to have competed for Australia in Melbourne as she holds dual nationality.  
 "I need to be patient, get my confidence back and find new evidence I can run on the track," she added. 
 "We will see how it goes, but if the track is ruled out, I might, having donetwo already this year, do all of the Great Run events, including the EthiopianRun." 
 That decision would see her competing in Edinburgh on 7 May over 10 kilometresand a fortnight later over the same distance at the BUPA Great Manchester Runwhich she won two years ago. 
 Then O'Sullivan would seek to regain the Great North Run half-marathon titleon 1 October and challenge again three weeks later in the GreatSouth Run, where four years ago she set what was then a world record for the10-mile distance. 
 The Great Ethiopian Run is scheduled for Addis Ababa in November.
