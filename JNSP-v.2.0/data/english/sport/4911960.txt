British quartet fail in World bid

  Great Britain missed out in the defence of their team pursuit title to Australia at the World Track Championships in Bordeaux on Saturday.  
 The British quartet of Stephen Cummings, Robert Hayles, Paul Manning and Geraint Thomas looked to have reeled in Australia late on. 
 But the Aussie line-up, who were second to England at the Commonwealth Games, pipped them by just 0.036 seconds. 
 The Ukraine took the bronze after outwitting the Netherlands.  
 Britain clinched a second silver on Saturday courtesy of Victoria Pendleton, who like the pursuit line-up had arrived in France as defending champion. 
 But the 25-year-old from Hertfordshire was blown away in the first leg of the best-of-three event by Belarussian Natallia Tsylinskaya. 
          I knew finishing in the top six was feasible, but we'll see whether I can carry that over      Craig McLean        And Tsylinskaya, who had previously won the women's time trial, clinched the second leg to relegate Pendleton to the silver medal. 
 Earlier on track, Commonwealth champion Mark Cavendish struggled and finished out of the medals in the scratch race. 
 The Isle of Man rider had matched eventual winner Jerome Neuville early in the event but fell well back of the pace in the latter stages. 
 But Craig McLean enjoyed much better fortunes and remains on course for a medal in the sprint after impressing in the early rounds. 
 McLean, who was part of the team to win sprint silver behind France on Thursday, set a time of 10.111 seconds to finish behind gold-medal favourite Theo Bos, from Holland. 
 He was also behind Bos' time in the quarter-finals but will battle it out for a medal in Sunday's semi-final. 
 McLean admitted he was pleasantly surprised with his display. 
 "I knew finishing in the top six was feasible, but we'll see whether I can carry that over," said the 35-year-old. 
 "The top times are very close together, so that shows it's going to be a very tight competition."
