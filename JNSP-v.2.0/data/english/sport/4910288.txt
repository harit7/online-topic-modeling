Profile: Prasanna Jayawardene

        FACTFILE       Born:  9/10/79, Colombo    Right-hand batsman; wicket-keeper     Test debut:  v Pakistan,  Kandy 28/6/00    ODI debut:  v Pakistan,  Sharjah 4/4/03       Before the emergence of Kumar Sangakkara, Jayawardene appeared likely to become Sri Lanka's first-choice keeper in Test cricket.  
 He was part of the squad which toured England in 1998 and made his Test debut two years later. 
 But he soon found himself sidelined as Sangakkara's superior batting ability made him an automatic selection. 
 Jayawardene has three first-class hundreds, but will again have to settle for playing in warm-up matches.
