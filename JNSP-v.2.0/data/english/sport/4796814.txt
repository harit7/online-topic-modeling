GB hockey team thrashed by Canada

  Great Britain's hockey team slumped to a comprehensive 9-0 defeat at the hands of Canada on the opening day of events at the Paralympic Games in Turin.  
 Following Friday's impressive opening ceremony, a 3,000 crowd turned out to watch a disappointing British display. 
 Coach Kevin Whiteman said: "It was a massive achievement for us to qualify for the Games, but this highlights the difference in quality at this level." 
 Elsewhere, Briton Liz Miller finished a creditable 10th in the downhill skiing.  
 And the 26-year-old was delighted with her performance, saying: "This is my first performance at these games and I'm delighted. 
 "I clocked around the time I was hoping to, so I can't ask for more than that." 
 Britain's hockey team could face an even sterner test on Sunday, when they face world champions Norway. 
 But Whiteman insisted: "We won't be downhearted and we will look forward to matching up against another fine side."
