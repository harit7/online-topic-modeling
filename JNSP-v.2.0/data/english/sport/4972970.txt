Woosnam issues Ryder Cup warning

  Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam is urging some of Europe's big names to compete more at home or risk their chances of making the team in September.  
 Padraig Harrington, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood, all members of 2004's winning side, are outside the 10 automatic qualifying spots for the K Club. 
 They may have to rely on wildcards but Woosnam could give priority to others. 
 "I have to be firm and say that people who play more in Europe will have a better chance of making it," he said.  
 Places for Europe's 12-man team come via the top five on a world points table and the top five in the European list, excluding those already in via the world list, and two captain's picks. 
 "They can think what they like, but we are a European team," added the Welshman. 
 "There is a lot of money to be made in America but they have to make the choice of trying to make it on world ranking points or the Order of Merit. 
 "If they are playing here they get both ranking points and Order of Merit points." 
 Woosnam will seek to get his point across when the majority of the tour's top names gather at Wentworth for the BMW Championship at the end of May.
