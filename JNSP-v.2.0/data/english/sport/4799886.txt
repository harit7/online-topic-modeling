Rose blooms on Paralympics debut

  Britain's Sean Rose came an impressive sixth in the downhill skiing on day two of the Winter Paralympics in Turin.  
 The Northampton athlete, competing in his first Paralympics, was just 0.7 seconds outside of the medals in the event, won by American Kevin Bramble. 
 But it was not such a good day for Britain's other competitor Russell Docker, who crashed out on his run. 
 The skiing competition continues on Monday with Great Britain's Liz Miller in action in the Super-G.  
 It was a day of mixed fortunes for Team GB in the  wheelchair curling,  which began on Sunday in Pinerolo. 
 Britain lost a hard-fought battle 4-3 to Switzerland in their opening match but shrugged off that disappointment to beat Denmark 5-3 in their afternoon game. 
               
 British skip Frank Duffy said the team had not been dispirited by their losing start. 
 "Despite the defeat from the morning game, we were always confident that we would get it together against Denmark," he told BBC Sport. 
 "The one thing we learned against Switzerland was that we just needed to hang in there." 
 GB have two matches on Monday, against Norway and Sweden. 
 It was another disappointing day for Britain's  sledge hockey  team, who slumped to their second successive defeat. 
 Although their play was much improved from Saturday's 9-0 drubbing by Canada, Team GB were outgunned 6-0 by one of the co-favourites, Norway. 
 Britain's final group match comes against Italy on Wednesday.
