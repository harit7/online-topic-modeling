Ouija Board leaves it too late

   Frankie Dettori had to settle for third place on 5-2 favourite Ouija Board in the Audemars Piguet Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin.  
 The dual Classic-winning mare put up an eye-catching performance in Hong Kong but could not catch Irridescence or runner-up Best Gift in the Group One contest. 
 Ed Dunlop's fears about a lack of pace in the 10-furlong contest were confirmed as Dettori was forced to sit and suffer well adrift of the principals in the early exchanges. 
 While Irridescence, ridden by Weichong Marwing, and Best Gift fought it out at the head of affairs from the outset, Ouija Board was fourth-last at the half-way stage. 
 Dettori, who was replacing Kieren Fallon aboard the four-time Group-One winner, came with a late run but it was not enough. 
          She felt as good as ever, and I don't see why she shouldn't have a great season ahead of her      Frankie Dettori  Ouija Board's jockey        
 Irridescence, who made virtually all of the running, finished a head in front of from Best Gift at odds of 5-1. 
 Ouija Board finished the same distance further in arrears to leave Dettori to reflect on what could have been. 
 "She broke slowly and didn't have the pace to go with them early on," he said. 
 "At a mile and a half she would have been the winner, I just ran out of track and things didn't go her way. 
 "She felt as good as ever, and I don't see why she shouldn't have a great season ahead of her." 
 Ouija Board could now be targeted for the Coronation Cup at Epsom on 2 June or the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot on 29 July.
