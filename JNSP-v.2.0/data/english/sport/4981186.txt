Hoy takes debut win at Badminton

  Andrew Hoy realised a 27-year dream at the Mitsubishi Motors Badminton Horse Trials when he coasted home on Sue Magnier's Moonfleet.  
 Hoy jumped a clear showjumping round to keep Germany's Ingrid Klimke and Sleep Late in second place and secure the £50,000 winner's purse. 
 Hoy said: "I knew Moonfleet was capable. It was just if I could ride well enough on the day." 
 The 47-year-old is the holder of three consecutive Olympic team gold medals.  
 Hoy first rode at Badminton in 1979 and has had to wait 27 years to break his Badminton duck. 
 Hoy paid tribute to the work done on Moonfleet by his German wife Bettina, who rode the 15-year-old horse in his pre-Badminton outings. 
 Hoy said: "She told me three weeks ago he could win. I didn't believe her, but perhaps I will listen to her more now." 
 Klimke, 38, could not believe she had finished so near the top at her first try. 
 "When I came to watch Badminton 11 years ago, I thought it was impossible," she said. 
 Oliver Townend, the 23-year-old from Market Harborough who was in Britain's European squad last September, was Britain's top performer, just hanging on to third place after two showjumping mistakes with Flint Curtis. 
 Jeanette Brakewell, from Uttoxeter, received a well-deserved accolade for bringing 18-year-old Over To You, who has been in a record eight Championship sides for Britain, into fourth place with clear cross country and showjumping rounds. 
 William Fox-Pitt, early favourite for the Mitsubishi on Tamarillo until the horse was withdrawn after the dressage, took ninth on his 2005 Burghley winner Ballincoola, making seven British riders in the top 10. 
 Fox-Pitt lost his chance to finish third when Ballincoola lowered the fourth fence and plummeted six places.
