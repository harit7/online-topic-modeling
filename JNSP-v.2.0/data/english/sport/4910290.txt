Profile: Chaminda Vaas

        FACTFILE       Born:  27/1/74, Mattumagala    Left-hand batsman; left arm medium fast bowler     Test debut:  v Pakistan,  Kandy 26/8/94    ODI debut:  v India,  Rajkot 15/2/94        
   Vaas's record puts him head and shoulders above any other Sri Lankan seam bowler, past or present.  
 Since the retirement of Pakistan's Wasim Akram, he is the premier left-arm new ball bowler in world cricket. 
 Vaas is equally at home with either red or white ball in his hand, but still has something to prove in England. 
 On the 2002 tour, he only managed four wickets in three Tests at a cost of 100 runs each and will be keen to show that was an aberration.
