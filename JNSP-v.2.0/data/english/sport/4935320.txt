Superb Doherty overcomes Stevens

  Ken Doherty took a stranglehold of the final session of his match with Matthew Stevens to win 13-8 and book a place in the World Championship last eight.  
 The pair were tied at 8-8 and a tense finale was on the cards, but Doherty, winner in 1997, did not give Stevens a sniff to win five frames on the bounce. 
 The Irishman, 36, made four breaks over 50, including a 69 and 67 in the 12th. 
 A three-ball plant in the 21st frame was the highlight of an outstanding performance from Doherty.  
 The Irishman explained how he overcame a miss on the black in the 16th frame to beat Stevens. 
 "I didn't sleep too well last night," said the 36-year-old, who will face Marco Fu in the quarter-finals. 
 "People were probably writing me off after I missed the black, but it didn'tweigh me down. 
 "I settled into my stride and started to feel like I would make a high break or clear up every time I got in." 
 Stevens paid tribute to Doherty, after his opponent's impressive winning run of five frames to snatch victory. 
 "Ken scored heavily today and I didn't get much of a look-in," said the Welshman. 
 "I felt great all the way through the match and didn't do much wrong. He just played fantastic snooker. 
 "Maybe he doesn't make the highest breaks but he kept getting 40 or 50 ahead and then tying me up with his tactical play."
