Champion Murphy overcomes Wattana

  World champion Shaun Murphy eased into the second round at The Crucible with a 10-4 win over Thailand's James Wattana.  
 Murphy, suffering from a chest infection, was not at his best but neither was his opponent who made numerous mistakes during the match. 
 Wattana, 6-3 down after the first session, won the 10th thanks to a 63 break, but a mistake in the next cost him dear, having made a 55. 
 Murphy wrapped up the next three to book his place in the second round.  
 The victorious player said his illness was causing him trouble against Wattana, but warned there was more to come from him. 
 "I got half an hour sleep the night before. My head is hurting, my throat is sore and I can't get my breath." said Murphy. 
 "That's a good win without making a 60 break. On Thursday, if I feel a lot better I could cause some damage. 
 "My tactical game is better. If I get my potting boots on then look out."
