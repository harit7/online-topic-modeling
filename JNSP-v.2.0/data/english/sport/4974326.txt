Raikkonen keeps his options open

   European Grand Prix, 5 May, 1300 BST  
   Kimi Raikkonen has hinted that joining Renault may be an option if he decides to leave McLaren this year.  
 The Finn's contract expires at the end of the season, and he has been linked with a move to Ferrari, where Michael Schumacher's deal will have expired. 
 But Raikkonen said: "There are only really three teams these last two years who have been capable (of winning). 
 "There are not many different positions where I would go. I don't think it will be a big surprise whatever I decide."  
 The F1 paddock has been rife with rumours that Raikkonen has made a pre-contract agreement with Ferrari to join them after this season. 
 But Renault need to replace world champion Alonso - who is joining McLaren - and, Raikkonen aside, there is little in the way of world-class alternatives. 
 Mercedes boss Norbert Haug remains hopeful his 26-year-old star driver "is open" to staying at McLaren after five seasons without a title. 
 But he said: "I am sure other people are trying to get him - it is not only Ferrari. 
 Raikkonen trails Alonso by 18 points in the championship after four races, having failed to mount any significant challenge. 
 But McLaren are hopeful of better things in this weekend's European Grand Prix at their home circuit the Nurburgring. 
 Haug added: "Anything can happen in F1. It can look quite different after this weekend. There are lots of points to score and we will improve our performance that is for sure."
