Keep your distance

  
  Outfighting is the term used to describe the techniques adopted by boxers fighting at a distance to each other.  
 These include arm's-length punches and nimble footwork. 
 Skilful boxers work hard on developing their outfighting techniques because it's the best way to tire out and attack an opponent. 
 Keeping your distance also lessens the opportunities for your opponent to counter-attack.
