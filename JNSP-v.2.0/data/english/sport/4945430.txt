Before You Go takes Epsom victory

   The odds-on favourite Before You Go had to work hard to outpace his two rivals in the Blue Riband Trial Stakes at Epsom.  
 Under the guidance of Ian Mongan, the Terry Mills-trained horse took a while to get going in the slowly run race. 
 Sienna Storm, ridden by Darryl Holland, had looked well placed but was found out for speed at the crucial time. 
 When Mongan called on his mount for a winning effort in the final furlong, he responded well to mark himself out as a challenger for the Derby at the same track on 3 June. 
 Before You Go was given a quote of 66-1 for the colts' Classic, but Mills believes he may be overpriced. 
 "He's a lovely horse who can be ridden any way," said Mills of the winner, who could go to the Lingfield Derby Trial before returning for a shot at Epsom glory. 
 "You can switch him off halfway then ask him to quicken up again and he'll go and do it for you.
