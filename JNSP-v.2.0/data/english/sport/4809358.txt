GB curlers secure semi-final spot

  The Great Britain wheelchair curling team clinched a semi-final place at the Winter Paralympics with a 5-2 victory over the USA.  
 Britain finished in joint second after the round-robin phase but advanced on countback to face Sweden on Friday. 
 They led 2-0 after two ends but the USA responded with two stones in the next end to level the match. 
 But Frank Duffy and his team kept their nerve to go ahead again in the fourth end and they held on for the victory.  
 Team member Mick McCreadie, who celebrates his 60th birthday on Thursday, was delighted with the win. 
 "We're really pleased to be in the last four because we have had some tough matches," he said. 
 "You can't expect to win every game but it shows the determination of the team that we have never given up. We have won the world championships representing Scotland and everyone wants to beat us." 
 The GB sledge hockey team lost 3-0 to Sweden in their play-off for fifth to eighth place and will face Italy, who lost 10-1 to Japan, for seventh place on Friday. 
 GB missed a host of chances against the Swedes and paid the price as their opponents scored in each of the three periods.
