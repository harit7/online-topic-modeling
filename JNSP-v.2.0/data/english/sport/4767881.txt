Fulham ready to sell Malbranque

  Fulham are ready to sell midfielder Steed Malbranque after he rejected the offer of a new contract.  
 Malbranque was offered what the club call "the most significant financial package in Fulham's history" to extend his stay beyond next summer. 
 However on their website, Fulham say: "Unfortunately Steed has indicated no offer would be acceptable as he wants to leave next year on a free transfer. 
 "This would be unacceptable to the club so we will listen to offers for him."  
 The statement added: "Fulham began its negotiations to renew the contract of Steed Malbranque in the summer of 2005. 
 "Steed potentially leaving on a free transfer is obviously a situation that has clear financial implications. 
 "The manager, with the support of the chairman and the board, is actively seeking a replacement for him for next season." 
 Malbranque joined Fulham from Lyon for £5m in the summer of 2001. 
 He has made over 200 appearances for the club and scored more than 40 goals.
