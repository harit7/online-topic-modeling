Robertson holds on against Hunter

  Neil Robertson survived a spirited fightback from Paul Hunter to win 10-5 and book a tie with Stephen Lee in the last 16 of the World Championship.  
 The Australian, 24, took a 7-2 lead into the final session, but found it difficult to sew up the win. 
 Hunter, who is battling cancer, fell behind 8-2 before taking advantage of his opponent's nerves to make it 8-4. 
 The pair shared the next two, before Robertson steadied himself in a tense 15th frame to win the match.  
          I didn't think I would make it here because I was in a pretty bad way      Paul Hunter

 But after the mid-session interval Robertson won the next five frames making breaks of 83 and 85.
