Kenyans dominate Boston marathon

  Kenyans Robert Cheruiyot and Rita Jeptoo won the men's and women's races in the Boston Marathon on Monday.  
 Cheruiyot, the 2003 champion, set a course record of two hours, seven minutes, 14 seconds, lowering the former mark by one second. 
 He beat the previous record set by fellow Kenyan Cosmas Ndeti in 1994. 
 "I thought maybe I was going to slow down but I was very strong," said Cheruiyot, 27, who edged out Benjamin Maiyo and American Meb Keflezighi.  
 It was the 14th time in the last 16 years that a Kenyan has won the world's oldest annually contested marathon. This was the 110th running of the Boston event. 
 Kenya's Maiyo finished second in 2:08:21 and Keflezighi, who was born in Eritrea, third in 2:09:56 - the fastest time for an American in 21 years. Americans Brian Sell finished in fourth place and Alan Culpepper in fifth. 
 It was the first time three Americans have finished in the top five since 1985. No American has won the race since Greg Myer in 1983. 
 "The crowd support was unbelievable," said Culpepper. 
 "People were saying 'we believe in you, we believe in you'. We haven't had that in a long time. 
 "It bodes very well for the future. Three or four years ago I don't know if there would have been so many guys there to pick up the slack." 
 In the women's field, Jeptoo clocked 2:23.38, becoming third straight Kenyan woman to win the race. 
 She overtook last year's New York marathon winner Jelena Prokopcuka of Latvia and Reiko Tosa of Japan. 
 "I'm happy so much," said the 25-year-old Jeptoo. 
 Her time fell short of the women's course record of 2:20:43, set by Margaret Okayo of Kenya in 2002. 
 The race kicked off a two-year World Marathon Majors series involving the five big city marathons - Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. 
 The overall men's and women's winners will claim $500,000 (£284,000) each. 
 The Boston win gives Cheruiyot 25 points in the Majors.
