        FINAL LEADERBOARD      US unless stated    -12  M Hyun Kim (Kor)   -10  l Ochoa (Mex), K Webb (Aus)   -5  A Sorenstam (Swe)   Selected others:    -3  J Moodie (Sco)   -2  L Wright (Eng)   +3  J Morley (Eng)   +4  C Matthew (Sco)      South Korea's Mi Hyun Kim clinched her sixth LPGA title with a final-round 71 in the Ginn Open in Florida.  
 Kim finished on 12 under overall, two shots clear of Mexico's Lorena Ochoa (66) and Australia's Karrie Webb (67). 
 Sweden's world number one Annika Sorenstam finished five shots further back in fourth after posting a 67. 
 Scotland's Janice Moodie, who is five months pregnant, also fired a 67 and finished in a three-way tie for ninth, her best result of the year.   
 "I'm playing great and feeling fine," said the Glasgow 32-year-old after a five-birdie round. 
 "I'm hoping to play in another four tournaments before I take time off to have the baby." 
 Kim, three ahead overnight, was pushed all the way by Ochoa and the resurgent Webb. But a two-putt birdie at the long 17th clinched the $230,000 (£126,000) prize.
