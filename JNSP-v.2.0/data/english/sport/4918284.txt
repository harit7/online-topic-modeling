Arthur set for Gulyakevich test

  Promoter Frank Warren says facing Sergey Gulyakevich will prime Alex Arthur for a world title shot.  
 He was due to fight Ghana's George Ashie on 29 April, but now faces the Belarussian's mandatory challenge for his European super featherweight crown. 
 Warren said: "I want Alex to fight for a world title before the end of 2006, and going in with Gulyakevich will give him the kind of experience he needs." 
 Gulyakevich has an 18-0 record, with the last four wins coming through KOs.  
 Along the way he has picked up Belarus' super-featherweight title and the WBA intercontinental lightweight belt. 
 The latter came with a second-round win over former European super featherweight champion Tontcho Tontchev. 
 Warren added: "Gulyakevich is as dangerous as they come, but I expect Alex to have a little bit too much for him." 
 Arthur, 27, who has a 22-1 record, won the title against Boris Sinitsin and made a successful first defence against fellow Scot Ricky Burns in February.
