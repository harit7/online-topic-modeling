Alonso lays down marker in Spain

  Fernando Alonso shrugged off a speeding fine to clock the fastest time of the recognised race drivers in free practice at the Spanish Grand Prix.  
 The 24-year-old was fined $2,000 (£1,055) for speeding in the pit lane in the first session of practice. 
 But along with the rest of the big guns, Alonso took the second session more seriously to trail test drivers Anthony Davidson and Robert Doornbos. 
 Michael Schumacher was sixth, behind Alexander Wurz and Christian Klien.  
 The morning session was a low-key affair with several teams saving their engines. 
 Schumacher and his Ferrari team-mate Felipe Massa went quickest in that session, but only three race drivers actually went out to set times. 
 Meanwhile, McLaren's Kimi Raikkonen did not leave the garage in the first session and was only 15th in the second. 
 Alonso could be handicapped in Sunday's Grand Prix by using the same engine he raced with at the Nuerburgring last week, while Schumacher and Massa both have fresh engines.
