Ryder format set for discussion

  Ryder Cup chiefs are to discuss extending the event to four days from the traditional three.  
 The biennial matchplay event between Europe and USA currently begins on a Friday but officials will look into bringing the start forward in 2010. 
 The move would spread the matches out, helping to combat Welsh autumn weather, and also increase revenues. 
 "It is a situation we are looking at," said Sandy Jones, chief executive of the Professional Golfers' Association.  
 "No decision has yet been taken and won't be for some time. Certainly not until later this year at the earliest." 
 The 2010 competition will take place at Wales' Celtic Manor but owing to a restructure of the American PGA season from 2007, the event is likely to move from its September slot to October. 
 But shortened daylight and the increased threat of inclement weather could hamper the event in its current format. 
 One proposal is to hold five four-ball matches on Thursday, two series of five foursomes matches on Friday, five more four-balls on Saturday and the usual 12 singles on Sunday. 
               
 "The proper thing to consider is the playing of the matches," Jones told The Times. 
 "Some people say the three days is so intense they do not want a fourth day. 
 "Others say that adding an extra day would reduce the intensity." 
 The 2006 Ryder Cup is set for the K Club outside Dublin, Ireland from 22-24 September. 
 In 2008 the event will be staged at Valhalla, Kentucky, USA.
