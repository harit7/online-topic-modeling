Garzelli grabs glory in Frankfurt

  Italy's Stefano Garzelli edged out favourite Erik Zabel in a mass sprint to win the Round the Henninger Tower race in Frankfurt on Monday.  
 Garzelli finished the 190km race in four hours 34 minutes 20 seconds with four-time winner Zabel down in fourth. 
 Germany's Gerald Ciolek was second and his compatriot Danilo Hondo third. 
 Hondo was banned for two years in January after testing positive for the stimulant carphedon, only to have the ban temporarily lifted by a court.  
 Hondo challenged his exclusion through a little-known provision in the Court of Arbitration for Sport statutes that allows residents of Switzerland to appeal to a provincial court. 
 Hondo has a home in the southern part of the country. 
 The final decision in his case is expected in six months.
