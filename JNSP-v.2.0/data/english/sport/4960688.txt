  Australia's Cadel Evans stormed to victory on the Tour of Romandie with a scintillating time-trial ride.  
 The Davitamon rider rode the final 20.4km stage in a time of 26 minutes and 19 seconds - enough to grab overall first place by just 27 seconds. 
 Evans beat Alberto Contador by 51 seconds in Lausanne on Sunday to push the Spaniard into second overall. 
 Spain's Alejandro Valverde finished third overall, but retained the lead in the season-long ProTour competition.
