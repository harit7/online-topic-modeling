Macs Joy too good for Brave Inca

        ACC BANK CHAMPION HURDLE       1 Macs Joy  11-4  B Geraghty (J Harrington)    2 Brave Inca  4-5 fav  T McCoy (C Murphy)    3 Hardy Eustace  4-1  C O'Dwyer (D Hughes)       Macs Joy upset the formbook by claiming an impressive four-length victory over Brave Inca in the ACC Champion Hurdle at Punchestown on Friday.  
 With Barry Geraghty on board, Macs Joy overturned the Champion Hurdle placings at Cheltenham last month when he had been edged out by Brave Inca. 
 However, Brace Inca, ridden by Tony McCoy, was struggling three fences from home as Macs Joy surged clear. 
 Hardy Eustace made the early running and held off Essex to take third place.   
 McCoy agreed that Brave Inca had never been travelling well in Friday's race. 
 "Brave Inca didn't have the spark today that he has had in the past although I don't want to take anything away from Macs Joy," said McCoy. 
 Despite his horse's defeat, Brave Inca's trainer Colm Murphy was far from despondent. 
 "We've always said two miles around here might get him beat," said the County Wexford handler. 
 "All credit to Macs Joy. Brave Inca will go out to grass now, he deserves it and hashad a serious year."
