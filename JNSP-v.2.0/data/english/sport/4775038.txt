In-form Murphy sets up Lee final

  World champion Shaun Murphy will play Stephen Lee in the Welsh Open final after contrasting semi-final victories.  
 Lee needed a deciding frame to edge past Anthony Hamilton 6-5 while Murphy thrashed Barry Hawkins 6-1. 
 Lee had built a 5-3 lead and looked set to wrap up victory before Hamilton fought back, but Lee clinched the deciding frame with a break of 72. 
 Murphy was too strong for Hawkins, compiling breaks of 134 and 102 to win the last two frames.  
 "That's the sort of snooker I've been producing in the practice room and I was very pleased to bring it out in the match," he said after the win. 
 "My all-round game was very good. My potting, break-building and safety were all strong so I'm very pleased. 
 "I seem to be hitting a good patch of form. I've gone into every tournament this season having worked really hard and ready to play but it's started to happen for me this week." 
 The match between Lee and Hamilton was suspended for 15 minutes in the eighth frame when Lee, the world number 10, dislodged his cue tip while playing a power shot on the blue. 
 Lee was forced to dash backstage to reaffix the tip - and when he returned momentum shifted. 
 "I started to do stupid things with the white and my tip flew off," he said. "That knocked me back a bit but luckily I managed to get across the line. 
 "Relieved - that's probably the best way to describe how I feel at the moment. 
 "Now I've got to decide whether to keep the same tip on for the final - I've played well with it on - or put on a new one."
