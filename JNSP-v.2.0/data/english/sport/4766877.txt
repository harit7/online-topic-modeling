  League Two Shrewsbury have signed Oldham defender Danny Hall and Chester midfielder Stuart Drummond.  
 Hall, 22, primarily plays at centre-half although he can also slot in at full-back for Gary Peters' side. 
 Drummond, 30, was voted Chester's player of the season after netting seven goals throughout the campaign. 
 Shrewsbury boss Gary Peters told the club's website: "Danny is our type of player, and Stuart is a great signing for us."
