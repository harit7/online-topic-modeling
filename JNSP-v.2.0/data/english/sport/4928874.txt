Murphy completes win over Davis

  Defending champion Shaun Murphy needed just four frames on Saturday to beat Steve Davis 13-7 and book his place in the World Championship quarter-finals.  
 Murphy resumed 11-5 up and quickly extended his advantage over the six-time champion, now 48. 
 Davis won frames 18 and 19 but could not stop the 23-year-old from Rotherham from wrapping up a deserved victory. 
 Murphy will now play the winner of the second-round match between Peter Ebdon, winner in 2002, and David Gray.  
 After his match, Murphy hit out at fellow players, who have complained about the state of the tables in Sheffield. 
 "The pockets are playing smaller and the cloth is quite heavy so you have to hit the ball harder," he said. 
 "Play stagnated a bit every now and again between me and Steve and it was a bit stop-start, but it's the same for everyone. 
 "I'm amazed at how many players have moaned about the speed of the tables. You just have to adapt and get on with it. 
 "I find it strange that players think the tables should be the same for every tournament. You don't get identical conditions all the time in other sports. 
 "I don't know if they are making excuses but adjusting to different conditions is as much of a skill as screwing the white ball back 10 feet, and this situation just highlights the players who can adapt."
