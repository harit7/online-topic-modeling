NFL drugs suspension for Williams

  Controversial Miami Dolphins running back Ricky Williams has been banned for the NFL's 2006-07 season after his fourth positive drugs test.  
 Williams failed in an attempt to overturn his latest violation in a meeting with NFL lawyers on 10 April. 
 "I'm disappointed with the decision but I respect it," said the former Heisman Trophy winner in a statement. 
 Williams previously tested positive for marijuana. He quit the NFL aged 27 in 2004 but returned with Miami last year.  
 When he retired for the first time, the troubled star said: "I just don't want to be in this business anymore." 
 Williams was seen as a potential NFL great after a fine college career. 
 But he failed to live up to his potential with the New Orleans Saints and was dogged by personal problems off the field. 
 He joined Miami in 2002 to try and kick-start his career, but after some initial success, his demons returned and he quit the sport two years later. 
 With the Dolphins chasing $5m which they claimed to be owed by Williams, he returned to the league last season. 
 Williams ran for 743 yards while sharing duties with rookie Ronnie Brown for the Dolphins.
