Drysdale sets the pace in Milan

        R2 LEADERBOARD      GB & Ire unless stated otherwise    -13  Drysdale   -11  Archer, Barham, Kjeldsen (Den), Molinari (Ita)   Selected others:    -9 M Roe    -8  B Dredge, I Woosnam  Missed cut:    -3  A Coltart  +1  A Cabrera (Arg)      Scotland's David Drysdale blazed his way to an eight-under-par 64 to take a two-shot lead after the second round of the Italian Open in Milan.  
 The 31-year-old lost his tour card by less than £400 last season after suffering a rib injury on the eve of the Dunhill Links Championship. 
 But Drysdale's caddie found a four-leaf clover beside the first green on Friday and his luck seems to have now changed. 
 Phillip Archer and Benn Barham are in the group of four tied for second.   
 Because he has lost his card Drysdale is only allowed to play a few tournaments on the European Tour and he said: "I definitely feel it's about time my luck changed. 
 "I should be playing out here and want to get back as quickly as possible, whether that is through the Challenge Tour or a good weekend here." 
 Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam is on eight under after a 66. 
 He was only two shots off the lead when he finished his round and joked: "Win this and I'll be playing captain!" 
 But he quickly added that he was not seriously considering playing in the Ryder Cup. 
 "I've never even thought about it. I'm not fit enough. Even if I won the Open or something I would still just do the captaincy," he insisted.
