Lewis-Francis to take on Powell

  Mark Lewis-Francis will clash with world record holder Asafa Powell in Oslo on 2 June as he targets gold in the European Championships in Sweden.  
 The 23-year-old Briton is desperate to make up for a disastrous Commonwealth Games, where he was disqualified for false starting in his 100m semi-final. 
 His manager Ricky Simms said: "The only place he can do this is on the track." 
 The sprinter's summer season starts on Saturday when he competes in the prestigious Penn Relays in America.  
 He will then fly down to Florida for a month and will run in several low-key college meetings. 
 Simms added: "The people close to Mark know that he is very determined to run well this year." 
 The European Championships are being staged in Gothenburg from 7-13 August.
