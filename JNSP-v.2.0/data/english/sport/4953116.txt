Kerr overcomes weather to lead

        FIRST ROUND LEADERBOARD      US unless stated    -7  C Kerr   -5  L Diaz, L Ochoa (Mex)   -3  T Hanson, P Creamer   Selected others:    -1  J Moodie (Sco)   Level  A Sorenstam   +1  J Head (Eng), J Morley (Eng)  +2  L Davies (Eng), B Morgan (Wal)      American Cristie Kerr defied gusting winds to shoot a 65 and lead the Ginn Open in Orlando by two shots.  
 Kerr's compatriot Laura Diaz and Mexican Lorena Ochoa tied for second place at the Reunion Resort event. 
 Scot Janice Moodie had a 71, one shot better than Annika Sorenstam while England's Laura Davies, who has missed every cut this year, carded a 74. 
 The start of the first round was delayed by heavy rain and 40 players had to complete their rounds on Friday.   
 Joanne Morley, who was one of those players was unable to finish her opening round, ended up on one over par together with fellow Englishwoman Johanna Head. 
 One of the most impressive rounds on the opening day came from American schoolgirl Dakota Dowd, who shot a 74. 
 The 13-year-old wad invited to play in the tournament so that her mother, who has terminal cancer, could see her take her first steps towards her aim of playing on the LPGA Tour. 
 Moodie, who is five months pregnant, had three birdies in her round and missed short chances for more at the 17th and 18th. 
 "I'm feeling really well, but just a little more tired than usual," said the 32-year-old, who will stop playing in June but intends to come back next season.
