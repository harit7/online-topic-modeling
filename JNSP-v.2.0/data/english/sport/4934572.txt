Dott claims quarter-final berth

  Scotland's Graeme Dott booked a World Championship quarter-final tie against Australian Neil Robertson by beating Nigel Bond 13-9 in Sheffield.  
 The 2004 finalist took a 10-6 lead into the final session, which became 11-6 before Bond struck back with a 75. 
 The Englishman also won the 19th frame on the black to cut the gap to three. 
 But Dott kept his opponent at bay in the following frame and, despite Bond's 74 to make it 12-9, held his nerve to book his place in the last eight.  
 The Scot was content rather than delighted following his win over Bond. 
 "I may not look it, but I'm happy," said the Glaswegian, who takes on Australia's Neil Robertson for a semi-final place. 
 "I knew it wouldn't be a pretty match because we have similar styles based on tactics rather than potting. 
 "But my game is in good shape and I responded well under pressure."
