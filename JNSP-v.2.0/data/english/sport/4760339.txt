Casserly resigns from Texans post

  Houston Texans general manager Charley Casserly has resigned from his post.  
 Casserly said he was leaving to pursue other opportunities in the NFL after guiding the Texans to a 2-14 record last season - the worst in the league. 
 "I have not been fired. There's absolutely no truth to that at all," said Casserly, who was with the Washington Redskins for 23 years. 
 Texans owner Bob McNair added: "No, he has not been fired, so you can forget that."
