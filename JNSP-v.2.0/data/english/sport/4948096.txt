McEwen takes first stage victory

  Australian Robbie McEwen dominated a bunch sprint to win the first stage of the Tour of Romandie on Wednesday.  
 The Davitamon-Lotto team sprinter burst ahead of a small group in the final 200 metres as they raced in the rain towards the line. 
 Italy's Paolo Savoldelli finished in the same time as McEwen but retained the overall lead following his victory in Tuesday's prologue. 
 Former Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich finished out of the top 10.  
 However he vowed that he would improve and said: "I will go through the pain barrier now. I am optimistic that it will all come together." 
 McEwen was making a comeback from a broken rib and said: "I've hardly raced in April because I broke a rib in a crash in Belgium but this win shows I'm back on form. 
 "I had two objectives at the Tour de Romandie - win this stage and work on my fitness for the Giro d'Italia." 
 The Tour of Romandie, which most of the peloton use as a warm-up for the Giro from May 6 to 28, continues until Sunday.
