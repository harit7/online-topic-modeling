Fu eases past lacklustre McManus

  Hong Kong's Marco Fu won six out of six frames to beat Alan McManus 10-3 and book his place in the second round of the World Championship.  
 Hong Kong's Fu, 26, took a 4-3 lead into the final session and then eased to frame wins, taking full advantage of a series of McManus errors. 
 McManus, 35, was a shadow of his former self and managed just 95 points in six frames played. 
 The Scot will now drop out of the top 16 for next season following the loss.  
 Fu said the seven-frame win over McManus was not as easy as the result suggested. 
 "This looks a good scoreline on paper but there were some close frames," said the Hong Kong player, who will now face Stephen Maguire. 
 "I started to play better after winning the first frame and the momentum went my way."
