Valverde edges thrilling finale

  Alejandro Valverde won a 10-man sprint to become the first Spanish winner of the Liege-Bastogne-Liege race.  
 Valverde beat Italy's Paolo Bettini and Damiano Cunego to snatch the lead in the ProTour standings. 
 Dutch veteran Michael Boogerd had broken away with six miles to go, leaving many of the pre-race favourites trailing by half a minute. 
 But the pack caught Boogerd on the final St Nicolas climb and Valverde timed his effort superbly for the win.  
 Valverde's victory was his second in five days after he won the Fleche Wallonne on Wednesday. 
 With its 114-year history, the 163-mile Liege-Bastogne-Liege is the oldest one-day classic and one of the biggest on the road racing calendar. 
 Valverde, who turns 26 on Tuesday, said: "Victory in the Fleche Wallonne gave me huge confidence coming into this race 
 "Winning an event that has such a rich heritage is something special, especially as I'm the first Spaniard to do it."
