Kjeldsen sets fierce Milan pace

 He carded nine birdies in a flawless 63 to match the mark set by England's Richard Finch last year. 
 The 2003 Diageo Championship winner at Gleneagles said: ""I've been playing well but just had some bad Sundays." 
 Kjeldsen is two shots clear of Benn Barham, with England's Phillip Archer and Andrew Butterfield among a group of seven who went round in 66.   
 The Dane admitted he had not made great progress since his maiden tour win three years ago. 
 "I think I've been in contention once since then and that's disappointing," he said. "I've just being getting a bit tense on Sundays. 
 "To play as relaxed as I played today is the key. I talk a lot more on the course now, I never used to say a word." 
 Tournament favourite Angel Cabrera of Argentina, at number 25 the highest world ranked player in Italy, trails leader Kjeldsen by eight strokes. 
 Veteran Eduardo Romero, 51, double-bogeyed the 18th but still shot a 70. 
 His contemporary Sam Torrance, 52, twice a winner of the event, posted 72. 
 European Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam outshot partner Paul Broadhurst - the Welshman shot a 70 to his rival's 74. 
 Woosnam is hoping that Broadhurst, who he played with in the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah Island, will qualify for this year's event in Ireland. 
 "Paul is one of the best at getting up and down and that is the kind of person you want," he said. 
 Broadhurst is currently lying eighth currently in Europe's points table, with 10 to qualify automatically.
