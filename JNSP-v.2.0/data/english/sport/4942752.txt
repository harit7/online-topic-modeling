GB hope for Radcliffe and Brown

  British selectors have left places open for Jon Brown and Paula Radcliffe in the Great Britain marathon teams for this summer's European Championships.  
 Realistically the pair, both currently injured, are almost certain to prefer a lucrative big city autumn marathon. 
 But a UK Athletics spokesman said: "The selectors decided places should be left open for them if they do decide they want to compete in the marathon." 
 Brown and Radcliffe both missed the London Marathon with foot injuries.  
 Radcliffe has always insisted defending her 10,000m title in Sweden is her top priority this summer. 
 Brown is well on the recovery trail and still to announce his future intentions, but said: "Right now I'm planning to work on improving my 5km/10km speed for the next six months." 
 That suggests the UK 10,000m record-holder is leaning towards an autumn marathon. 
 Dan Robinson, last month's Commonwealth bronze-medallist, heads the men's squad along with Tomas Abyu, Huw Lobb, Peter Riley and Matt Smith. 
 Liz Yelling, a Bedford team-mate of Radcliffe and third finisher in the Commonwealth marathon, has been named for the women's side along with Tracey Morris. 
 Mara Yamauchi, who moved to second slot on the UK-all time list when she finished an outstanding sixth in London, has turned down the opportunity to represent the team. 
 After contesting her fourth marathon in 12 months, she has decided she needs a rest, preferring to challenge for a 10,000m place. 
 Susan Partridge, 10th in the Games marathon and holder of the Europeanqualifying standard, also declined a spot after three hard races.
