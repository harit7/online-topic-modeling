Powerful Mauresmo sees off Hingis

  French top seed Amelie Mauresmo thrashed Martina Hingis 6-2 6-2 to ease into the final of the Qatar Open.  
 Mauresmo broke her Swiss opponent in the fifth game before racing clear to take the opening set with few problems. 
 Hingis secured two early breaks in the second but Mauresmo hit back with three breaks of her own to move 3-2 ahead. 
 The 26-year-old then reeled off three more games to reach the final where she will face second seed Nadia Petrova, who beat Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-1 7-6.  
 Petrova was 4-0 up in the second, but Sugiyama rattled off five games in a row to establish a 5-4 lead only for Petrova to win the tie-break 7-2.

 Mauresmo, who had not faced Hingis since Rome 2001, said: "I think I got it right out there. 
 "I served well and returned well. I was seeing the ball and really able to play my shots." 
 The Australian Open champion believes it will take a while for Hingis to return to the form that gave her five grand slam titles. 
 The 25-year-old only returned to the game in January after retiring in 2002 due to injury. 
 "Hingis is a great player. I don't think she has to prove anything," Mauresmo said. 
          Mauresmo is certainly the player to beat. I am not unhappy with my game because I know I'm progressing.      Martina Hingis        
 "Perhaps, coming back after a long gap and hitting top form will take some time." 
 Hingis admitted she was disappoionted after after wilting under Mauresmo's fierce onslaught in just 63 minutes. 
 "I lost to the best player," she admitted. "Mauresmo is certainly the player to beat. But I am not unhappy with my game because I know I'm progressing. 
 "Having said that I know there are certain areas of my game where I need to concentrate more."
