Belgians to clash in Munich final

  Kristof Vliegen will face fellow Belgian Oliver Rochus in Sunday's BMW Open final in Munich.  
 Vliegen will be playing for his first ATP title after thrashing third seed Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 6-1 6-2 in Saturday's semi-finals. 
 "Hopefully, this time around will be better," said Vliegen, who lost his only other final in Adelaide in 2003. "In my first final I was nervous." 
 Fifth seed Rochus defeated Austria's Jurgen Melzer 6-4 6-7 (1-7) 6-3.
